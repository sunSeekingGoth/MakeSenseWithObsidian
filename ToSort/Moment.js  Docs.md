## [Project Status](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/)

Moment.js has been successfully used in millions of projects, and we are happy to have contributed to making date and time better on the web. As of September 2020, Moment gets over 12 million downloads per week! However, Moment was built for the previous era of the JavaScript ecosystem. The modern web looks much different these days. Moment has evolved somewhat over the years, but it has essentially the same design as it did when it was created in 2011. Given how many projects depend on it, *we choose to prioritize stability over new features*.

As an example, consider that Moment objects are *mutable*. This is a common source of complaints about Moment. We address it [in our usage guidance](https://momentjs.com/guides/#/lib-concepts/mutability/) but it still comes as a surprise to most new users. Changing Moment to be immutable would be a breaking change for every one of the projects that use it. Creating a "Moment v3" that was immutable would be a tremendous undertaking and would make Moment a different library entirely. Since this has already been accomplished in other libraries, we feel that it is more important to retain the mutable API.

Another common argument against using Moment in modern applications is its size. Moment doesn't work well with modern "tree shaking" algorithms, so it tends to increase the size of web application bundles. If one needs internationalization or time zone support, Moment can get quite large. Modern web browsers (and Node.js) expose internationalization and time zone support via the [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) object, codified as [ECMA-402](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/). Libraries like [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) (and others) take advantage of this, reducing or removing the need to ship your own data files.

Recently, Chrome Dev Tools [started showing recommendations for replacing Moment](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828024054/https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721) for the size alone. We generally support this move.

-   [*4 alternatives to moment.js for internationalizing dates*](https://blog.logrocket.com/4-alternatives-to-moment-js-for-internationalizing-dates/)

The Moment team has discussed these issues at length. We recognize that many existing projects may continue to use Moment, but we would like to discourage Moment from being used in new projects going forward. Instead, we would like to [recommend alternatives](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/recommendations/) that are excellent choices for use in modern applications today. We would also like to promote the [`Temporal`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/future/) addition to the JavaScript language, which is looking for feedback and contributors.

**We now generally consider Moment to be a legacy project in maintenance mode. It is not *dead*, but it is indeed *done*.**

In practice, this means:

-   We will not be adding new features or capabilities.
-   We will not be changing Moment's API to be immutable.
-   We will not be addressing tree shaking or bundle size issues.
-   We will not be making *any* major changes (no version 3).
-   We may choose to not fix bugs or behavioral quirks, especially if they are long-standing known issues.

With specific regard to Moment's internationalization locale files:

-   We may choose to not accept corrections to locale strings or localized date formats, especially if they have been argued successfully for their present form.
-   You must make a new compelling argument for locale changes with significant, non-anecdotal evidence to support your position.
-   If the string or format you are asking to change is reflected in the [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/), then you must submit a change there *first* and have it accepted.

However, since we understand that Moment is well established in millions of existing projects:

-   We *will* address critical security concerns as they arise.
-   We *will* release data updates for Moment-Timezone following [IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) releases.

### Reasons to keep using Moment

In most cases, you should not choose Moment for new projects. However there are some possible reasons you might want to keep using it.

#### Browser support

Moment works well on Internet Explorer 8 and higher. By contrast, Luxon only works on IE 10 and higher and requires a polyfill to do so. [You can read more in Luxon's documentation.](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/matrix)

Other libraries have also had issues with Safari, especially on mobile devices. If you have a strong requirement to support older browsers, then you might want to stick with Moment for a bit longer.

However, [Day.js reports compatibility with IE8 and higher](https://day.js.org/docs/en/installation/installation) so you still may wish to consider that alternative.

#### Dependency by other libraries

Several other libraries, especially date pickers and graphing libraries, take Moment as a dependency. If you are using such a component and cannot find an alternative, then you are already including Moment in your project. Thus, it might make sense to continue using Moment throughout your project rather than including yet another date and time library.

#### Familiarity

If you are a long-time user of Moment, you may already understand its API and limitations well. If so, and the aforementioned issues are not a concern for you, then you certainly can continue to use it.

### [Recommendations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/recommendations/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/-project-status/01-recommendations.md)

There are several great options to consider using instead of Moment.

When choosing, consider that:

-   Some libraries are split into modules, plugins, or companion libraries.
-   Some libraries use the ECMAScript [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) API for locales, time zones, or both.
-   Some libraries still provide their own locale and time zone files like Moment and Moment-Timezone do.

**Here are the alternatives we recommend:**

### [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)

Luxon can be thought of as the evolution of Moment. It is authored by [Isaac Cambron](https://github.com/icambron), a long-time contributor to Moment. Please read [*Why does Luxon exist?*](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/why) and the [*For Moment users*](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/moment) pages in the Luxon documentation.

-   Locales: `Intl` provided
-   Time Zones: `Intl` provided

### [Day.js](https://day.js.org/)

Day.js is designed to be a minimalist replacement for Moment.js, using a similar API. It is not a drop-in replacement, but if you are used to using Moment's API and want to get moving quickly, consider using Day.js.

-   Locales: Custom data files that can be individually imported
-   Time Zones: `Intl` provided, via a plugin

### [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

Date-fns offers a series of functions for manipulating JavaScript [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) objects. For more details, scroll to "Why date-fns?" on the date-fns home page.

-   Locales: Custom data files that can be individually imported
-   Time Zones: `Intl` provided, via a separate companion library

### [js-Joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/)

js-Joda is a JavaScript port of Java's [Three-Ten Backport](https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/), which is the base for JSR-310 implementation of the Java SE 8 `java.time` package. If you are familiar with [`java.time`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html), [Joda-Time](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/), or [Noda Time](https://nodatime.org/), you will find js-Joda comparable.

-   Locales: Custom data files via add-on module
-   Time Zones: Custom data files via add-on module

### No Library

JavaScript has always had a [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object, defined ECMAScript (ECMA-262) specification [here](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#sec-date-objects).

When using `Date` objects, be aware of the following:

-   The `Date` object internally represents a Unix timestamp with millisecond precision. It offers functions that will convert to and from the system's local time zone, but it is *always* UTC internally. Unlike a `Moment` object, it *can not* be set to use another time zone; It has no concept of "mode".
    
-   Using [`Date.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse), or [`new Date(<string>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date#Timestamp_string) has been problematic and implemented inconsistently in the past. The [current specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#sec-date-time-string-format) defines parsing a variation of ISO 8601 strings, where date-only forms (like `"2020-09-14"`) are parsed as UTC, instead of local time as they would be by ISO 8601. Even then, not all modern implementations have implemented this specification correctly (e.g., Safari). Other types of strings *may* work, but parsing them is *implementation specific* and can vary significantly - especially with older browsers. Depending on the implementation, and the components provided in the string, you may be surprised with the result. For these reasons, we agree with [MDN's statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date#Timestamp_string) that **parsing strings with the `Date` object is strongly discouraged**.
    

Modern JavaScript environments will also implement the [ECMA-402](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402) specification, which provides the [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) object, and defines behavioral options of the `Date` object's `toLocaleString`, `toLocaleDateString`, and `toLocaleTimeString` functions.

When using the `Intl` object, be aware of the following:

-   Not every environment will implement the full specification. In particular, Node.js environments require internationalization support provided by ICU. See [the Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/intl.html) for further details.
-   The [ECMAScript Intl compatibility table (by kangax)](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esintl/) can be useful in determining which features are supported and which are not.
-   Most newer environments provide IANA time zone support via the `timeZone` option in the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` constructor (and in `Date.toLocaleString`, `Date.toLocaleDateString`, and `Date.toLocaleTimeString`). This option can be used to take the internal UTC-based timestamp of a `Date` object and get a *string* that has been converted to a named time zone. However, it *can not* be used to convert a `Date` object to a different time zone.

If the `Date` and `Intl` objects meet your needs and you fully understand their limitations, then you might consider using them directly.

### [The Future](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/future/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/-project-status/02-future.md)

## **Temporal** - Better dates and times in the JavaScript language!

One day soon, we hope there won't be a strong need for date and time libraries in JavaScript at all. Instead, we will be able to use capabilities of the JavaScript language itself. Though some capabilities are here today with [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl), we know from experience and data that there is significant room for improvement.

The effort to make better date and time APIs in the JavaScript language is being done via [The ECMA TC39 Temporal Proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html). It is currently at Stage 3 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.es/process-document/).

`Temporal` will be a new global object that acts as a top-level namespace (like `Math`). It exposes many separate types of objects including `Temporal.Instant`, `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`, `Temporal.PlainDateTime`, `Temporal.PlainDate`, `Temporal.PlainTime`, `Temporal.TimeZone` and several others. The [Temporal Cookbook](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html) shows many "recipes" with examples of how these objects can be used in different scenarios.

You can try out Temporal today, via [a non-production polyfill](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/tree/main/polyfill). Please give it a try, but don't use it in production (yet)!

Please provide feedback, and consider contributing to this effort - especially if you have experience using Moment or other date and time libraries!

## [Using Moment](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/)

Moment was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.

All code should work in both of these environments, and all unit tests are run in both of these environments.

Currently, the following browsers are used for the ci system: Chrome on Windows XP, IE 8, 9, and 10 on Windows 7, IE 11 on Windows 10, latest Firefox on Linux, and latest Safari on OSX 10.8 and 10.11.

If you want to try the sample codes below, just open your browser's console and enter them.

### [Node.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/node-js/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/01-node-js.md)

```
npm install moment
```

```
var moment = require('moment'); // require
moment().format(); 
```

Or in ES6 syntax:

```
import moment from 'moment';
moment().format();
```

**Note:** In **2.4.0**, the globally exported moment object was **deprecated**. It will be removed in next major release.

If you want to include Moment Timezone as well, see the [separate Moment Timezone docs for Node.js](https://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/use-it/node-js/) with examples.

### [Browser](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/browser/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/02-browser.md)

```
<script src="moment.js"></script>
<script>
    moment().format();
</script>
```

Moment.js is available on [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/moment.js) and on [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/moment).

### [Bower](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/bower/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/03-bower.md)

[bower](https://bower.io/)

```
bower install --save moment
```

Notable files are `moment.js`, `locale/*.js` and `min/moment-with-locales.js`.

### [Require.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/require-js/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/04-require-js.md)

We strongly recommend reading [this](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs/issues/1554#issuecomment-226269905) if you plan to use moment with Require.js. Also upgrade to **2.14.0** or above for best experience.

As a start, you might have acquired moment through bower or node\_modules or anything else that places moment.js together with a locales directory in a base folder. Then you should use a tool like [adapt-pkg-main](https://github.com/jrburke/adapt-pkg-main), or manually -- using [packages config](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#packages).

```
requirejs.config({
  packages: [{
    name: 'moment',
    // This location is relative to baseUrl. Choose bower_components
    // or node_modules, depending on how moment was installed.
    location: '[bower_components|node_modules]/moment',
    main: 'moment'
  }]
});
```

With the above setup, you can require the core with `moment` and `de` locale with `moment/locale/de`.

```
// only needing core
define(['moment'], function (moment) {
    console.log(moment().format('LLLL'));  // 'Friday, June 24, 2016 1:42 AM'
});

// core with single locale
define(['moment', 'moment/locale/de'], function (moment) {
    moment.locale('de');
    console.log(moment().format('LLLL')); // 'Freitag, 24. Juni 2016 01:42'
});

// core with all locales
define(['moment/min/moment-with-locales'], function (moment) {
    moment.locale('de');
    console.log(moment().format('LLLL')); // 'Freitag, 24. Juni 2016 01:42'
});

// async load locale
define(['require', 'moment'], function(require, moment) {
  // Inside some module after the locale is detected. This is the
  // case where the locale is not known before module load time.
  require(['moment/locale/de'], function(localeModule) {
    // here the locale is loaded, but not yet in use
    console.log(moment().format('LLLL'));  // 'Friday, June 24, 2016 1:42 AM'

    moment.locale('de');
    // Use moment now that the locale has been properly set.
    console.log(moment().format('LLLL')); // 'Freitag, 24. Juni 2016 01:42'
  })
});
```

For more complicated use cases please read [excellent explanation by @jrburke](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs/issues/1554#issuecomment-226269905).

Moment will still create a `moment` global, which is useful to plugins and other third-party code. If you wish to squash that global, use the `noGlobal` option on the module config.

```
require.config({
    config: {
        moment: {
            noGlobal: true
        }
    }
});
```

If you don't specify `noGlobal` then the globally exported moment will print a deprecation warning. From next major release you'll have to export it yourself if you want that behavior.

For version **2.5.x**, in case you use other plugins that rely on Moment but are not AMD-compatible you may need to add [`wrapShim: true`](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/b8a6982d2923ae8389355edaa50d2b7f8065a01a/build/example.build.js#L68-L78) to your r.js config.

**Note:** To allow moment.js plugins to be loaded in requirejs environments, moment is created as a named module. Because of this, moment **must** be loaded exactly as as `"moment"`, using `paths` to determine the directory. Requiring moment with a path like `"vendor\moment"` will return `undefined`.

**Note:** From version **2.9.0** moment exports itself as an anonymous module, so if you're using only the core (no locales / plugins), then you don't need config if you put it on a non-standard location.

### [NuGet](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/nuget/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/05-nuget.md)

### [meteor](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/meteor/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/06-meteor.md)

### [Browserify](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/browserify/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/07-browserify.md)

```
npm install moment
```

```
var moment = require('moment');
moment().format();
```

**Note:** There is a bug that prevents `moment.locale` from being loaded.

```
var moment = require('moment');
moment.locale('cs');
console.log(moment.locale()); // en
```

Use the workaround below

```
var moment = require('moment');
require('moment/locale/cs');
console.log(moment.locale()); // cs
```

In order to include all the locales

```
var moment = require('moment');
require("moment/min/locales.min");
moment.locale('cs');
console.log(moment.locale()); // cs
```

### [Webpack](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/webpack/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/08-webpack.md)

```
npm install moment
```

```
var moment = require('moment');
moment().format();
```

**Note:** By default, webpack bundles *all* Moment.js locales (in Moment.js 2.18.1, that’s 160 minified KBs). To strip unnecessary locales and bundle only the used ones, add [`moment-locales-webpack-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-locales-webpack-plugin):

```
// webpack.config.js
const MomentLocalesPlugin = require('moment-locales-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        // To strip all locales except “en”
        new MomentLocalesPlugin(),

        // Or: To strip all locales except “en”, “es-us” and “ru”
        // (“en” is built into Moment and can’t be removed)
        new MomentLocalesPlugin({
            localesToKeep: ['es-us', 'ru'],
        }),
    ],
};
```

There are other resources to optimize Moment.js with webpack, [for example this one](https://github.com/jmblog/how-to-optimize-momentjs-with-webpack).

### [Typescript](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/typescript/) 2.13.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/09-typescript.md)

As of version **2.13.0**, Moment includes a typescript definition file.

Install via NPM

```
npm install moment
```

Import and use in your Typescript file

```
const moment = require('moment');

let now = moment().format('LLLL');
```

**Note:** If you have trouble importing moment

For *Typescript 2.x* try adding `"moduleResolution": "node"` in `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` file

For *Typescript 1.x* try adding `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` in `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` file and then use the syntax

```
import moment from 'moment';
```

**Locale Import**

To use `moment.locale` you first need to import the language you are targeting.

```
import * as moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/pt-br';

console.log(moment.locale()); // en
moment.locale('fr');
console.log(moment.locale()); // fr
moment.locale('pt-br');
console.log(moment.locale()); // pt-br
```

### [System.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/system-js/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/00-use-it/10-system-js.md)

To load moment, place it in the path specified by your System.config in the baseURL configuration. Then import it into your page.

```
<script src="system.js"></script>
<script>
  System.config({
    baseURL: '/app'
  });

  System.import('moment.js');
 </script>
```

If you need moment to be loaded as global, you can do this with the meta configuration:

```
System.config({
  meta: {
    'moment': { format: 'global' }
  }
});
```

Alternatively, to provide Moment as a global to only a specific dependency, you can do this:

```
System.config({
  meta: {
    'path/to/global-file.js': {
      globals: {
        moment: 'moment'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## [Parse](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/)

Instead of modifying the native `Date.prototype`, Moment.js creates a wrapper for the `Date` object. To get this wrapper object, simply call `moment()` with one of the supported input types.

The `Moment` prototype is exposed through `moment.fn`. If you want to add your own functions, that is where you would put them.

For ease of reference, any method on the `Moment.prototype` will be referenced in the docs as `moment#method`. So `Moment.prototype.format` == `moment.fn.format` == `moment#format`.

**Please read:**

-   `moment(...)` is local mode. Ambiguous input (without offset) is assumed to be local time. Unambiguous input (with offset) is adjusted to local time.
-   `moment.utc(...)` is utc mode. Ambiguous input is assumed to be UTC. Unambiguous input is adjusted to UTC.
-   `moment.parseZone()` keep the input zone passed in. Ambiguous input is assumed to be UTC.
-   `moment.tz(...)` with the moment-timezone plugin can parse input in a specific time zone.

Keep in mind that a time zone and a time zone offset are two different things. An offset of -08:00 doesn't necessarily mean you are in the US Pacific time zone.

[See the Parsing Guide for additional information](https://momentjs.com/guides/#/parsing/).

### [Now](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/now/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/01-now.md)

```
moment();
moment(undefined);
// From 2.14.0 onward, also supported
moment([]);
moment({});
```

To get the current date and time, just call `moment()` with no parameters.

```
var now = moment();
```

This is essentially the same as calling `moment(new Date())`.

**Note:** From version **2.14.0**, `moment([])` and `moment({})` also return now. They used to default to start-of-today before 2.14.0, but that was arbitrary so it was changed.

**Note:** Function parameters default to `undefined` when not passed in. Moment treats `moment(undefined)` as `moment()`.

**Note:** Moments are created at evaluation time, so `moment().diff(moment())` may not always return 0. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/5195) for more details.

### [String](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/02-string.md)

When creating a moment from a string, we first check if the string matches known [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) formats, we then check if the string matches the [RFC 2822 Date time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.3) format before dropping to the fall back of `new Date(string)` if a known format is not found.

```
var day = moment("1995-12-25");
```

**Warning:** Browser support for parsing strings [is inconsistent](http://dygraphs.com/date-formats.html). Because there is no specification on which formats should be supported, what works in some browsers will not work in other browsers.

For consistent results parsing anything other than ISO 8601 strings, you should use [String + Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/).

#### Supported ISO 8601 strings

An ISO 8601 string requires a date part.

```
2013-02-08  # A calendar date part
2013-02     # A month date part
2013-W06-5  # A week date part
2013-039    # An ordinal date part

20130208    # Basic (short) full date
201303      # Basic (short) year+month
2013        # Basic (short) year only
2013W065    # Basic (short) week, weekday
2013W06     # Basic (short) week only
2013050     # Basic (short) ordinal date (year + day-of-year)
```

A time part can also be included, separated from the date part by a space or an uppercase T.

```
2013-02-08T09            # An hour time part separated by a T
2013-02-08 09            # An hour time part separated by a space
2013-02-08 09:30         # An hour and minute time part
2013-02-08 09:30:26      # An hour, minute, and second time part
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123  # An hour, minute, second, and millisecond time part
2013-02-08 24:00:00.000  # hour 24, minute, second, millisecond equal 0 means next day at midnight

20130208T080910,123      # Short date and time up to ms, separated by comma
20130208T080910.123      # Short date and time up to ms
20130208T080910          # Short date and time up to seconds
20130208T0809            # Short date and time up to minutes
20130208T08              # Short date and time, hours only
```

Any of the date parts can have a time part.

```
2013-02-08 09  # A calendar date part and hour time part
2013-W06-5 09  # A week date part and hour time part
2013-039 09    # An ordinal date part and hour time part
```

If a time part is included, an offset from UTC can also be included as `+-HH:mm`, `+-HHmm`, `+-HH` or `Z`.

```
2013-02-08 09+07:00            # +-HH:mm
2013-02-08 09-0100             # +-HHmm
2013-02-08 09Z                 # Z
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123+07:00  # +-HH:mm
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123+07     # +-HH
```

**Note:** Support for the week and ordinal formats was added in version **2.3.0**.

If a string does not match any of the above formats and is not able to be parsed with `Date.parse`, `moment#isValid` will return false.

```
moment("not a real date").isValid(); // false
```

#### The RFC 2822 date time format

Before parsing a RFC 2822 date time the string is cleansed to remove any comments and/or newline characters. The additional characters are legal in the format but add nothing to creating a valid moment instance.

After cleansing, the string is validated in the following space-separated sections, all using the English language:

```
6 Mar 17 21:22 UT
6 Mar 17 21:22:23 UT
6 Mar 2017 21:22:23 GMT
06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 Z
Mon 06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 z
Mon, 06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 +0000
```

1.  Day of Week in three letters, followed by an optional comma. (optional)
2.  Day of Month (1 or 2 digit), followed by a three-letter month and 2 or 4 digit year
3.  Two-digit hours and minutes separated by a colon (:), followed optionally by another colon and seconds in 2-digits
4.  Timezone or offset in one of the following formats:
5.  UT : +0000
6.  GMT : +0000
7.  EST | CST | MST | PST | EDT | CDT | MDT | PDT : US time zones\*
8.  A - I | K - Z : Military time zones\*
9.  Time offset +/-9999

\[\*\] See [section 4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-4.3) of the specification for details.

The parser also confirms that the day-of-week (when included) is consistent with the date.

### [String + Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/03-string-format.md)

```
moment(String, String);
moment(String, String, String);
moment(String, String, String[]);
moment(String, String, Boolean);
moment(String, String, String, Boolean);
```

If you know the format of an input string, you can use that to parse a moment.

```
moment("12-25-1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
```

The parser ignores non-alphanumeric characters by default, so both of the following will return the same thing.

```
moment("12-25-1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
moment("12/25/1995", "MM-DD-YYYY");
```

You may get unexpected results when parsing both date and time. The below example may not parse as you expect:

```
moment('24/12/2019 09:15:00', "DD MM YYYY hh:mm:ss");
```

You can use strict mode, which will identify the parsing error and set the Moment object as invalid:

```
moment('24/12/2019 09:15:00', "DD MM YYYY hh:mm:ss", true);
```

The parsing tokens are similar to the formatting tokens used in `moment#format`.

#### Year, month, and day tokens

*Tokens are case-sensitive.*

| Input | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `YYYY` | `2014` | 4 or 2 digit year. Note: Only 4 digit can be parsed on `strict` mode |
| `YY` | `14` | 2 digit year |
| `Y` | `-25` | Year with any number of digits and sign |
| `Q` | `1..4` | Quarter of year. Sets month to first month in quarter. |
| `M MM` | `1..12` | Month number |
| `MMM MMMM` | `Jan..December` | Month name in locale set by `moment.locale()` |
| `D DD` | `1..31` | Day of month |
| `Do` | `1st..31st` | Day of month with ordinal |
| `DDD DDDD` | `1..365` | Day of year |
| `X` | `1410715640.579` | Unix timestamp |
| `x` | `1410715640579` | Unix ms timestamp |

`YYYY` from version **2.10.5** supports 2 digit years in non `strict` mode, and converts them to a year near 2000 (same as `YY`).

`Y` was added in **2.11.1**. It will match any number, signed or unsigned. It is useful for years that are not 4 digits or are before the common era. It can be used for any year.

#### Week year, week, and weekday tokens

For these, the lowercase tokens use the locale aware week start days, and the uppercase tokens use the [ISO week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) start days.

*Tokens are case-sensitive.*

| Input | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gggg` | `2014` | Locale 4 digit week year |
| `gg` | `14` | Locale 2 digit week year |
| `w ww` | `1..53` | Locale week of year |
| `e` | `0..6` | Locale day of week |
| `ddd dddd` | `Mon...Sunday` | Day name in locale set by `moment.locale()` |
| `GGGG` | `2014` | ISO 4 digit week year |
| `GG` | `14` | ISO 2 digit week year |
| `W WW` | `1..53` | ISO week of year |
| `E` | `1..7` | ISO day of week |

#### Locale aware formats

Locale aware date and time formats are also available using `LT LTS L LL LLL LLLL`. They were added in version **2.2.1**, except `LTS` which was added **2.8.4**.

*Tokens are case-sensitive.*

| Input | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `L` | `09/04/1986` | Date (in local format) |
| `LL` | `September 4 1986` | Month name, day of month, year |
| `LLL` | `September 4 1986 8:30 PM` | Month name, day of month, year, time |
| `LLLL` | `Thursday, September 4 1986 8:30 PM` | Day of week, month name, day of month, year, time |
| `LT` | `8:30 PM` | Time (without seconds) |
| `LTS` | `8:30:00 PM` | Time (with seconds) |

#### Hour, minute, second, millisecond, and offset tokens

*Tokens are case-sensitive.*

| Input | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `H HH` | `0..23` | Hours (24 hour time) |
| `h hh` | `1..12` | Hours (12 hour time used with `a A`.) |
| `k kk` | `1..24` | Hours (24 hour time from 1 to 24) |
| `a A` | `am pm` | Post or ante meridiem (Note the one character `a p` are also considered valid) |
| `m mm` | `0..59` | Minutes |
| `s ss` | `0..59` | Seconds |
| `S SS SSS ... SSSSSSSSS` | `0..999999999` | Fractional seconds |
| `Z ZZ` | `+12:00` | Offset from UTC as `+-HH:mm`, `+-HHmm`, or `Z` |

From version **2.10.5**: fractional second tokens length 4 up to 9 can parse any number of digits, but will only consider the top 3 (milliseconds). Use if you have the time printed with many fractional digits and want to consume the input.

Note that the number of `S` characters provided is only relevant when parsing in strict mode. In standard mode, `S`, `SS`, `SSS`, `SSSS` are all equivalent, and interpreted as fractions of a second. For example, `.12` is always 120 milliseconds, passing `SS` will not cause it to be interpreted as 12 milliseconds.

`Z ZZ` were added in version **1.2.0**.

`S SS SSS` were added in version **1.6.0**.

`X` was added in version **2.0.0**.

`SSSSS ... SSSSSSSSS` were added in version **2.10.5**.

`k kk` were added in version **2.13.0**.

Unless you specify a time zone offset, parsing a string will create a date in the current time zone.

```
moment("2010-10-20 4:30",       "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm");   // parsed as 4:30 local time
moment("2010-10-20 4:30 +0000", "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z"); // parsed as 4:30 UTC
```

#### Era Year related tokens

*Tokens are case-sensitive.*

| Input | Examples | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| y .. yyyy | `5 +5 -500` | Years |
| yo | `5th 1st` | Ordinal Years |
| N | `AD` | Abbr Era name |
| NN | `AD` | Abbr Era name |
| NNN | `AD` | Abbr Era name |
| NNNN | `Anno Domini` | Full Era name |
| NNNNN | `AD` | Narrow Era name |

Era support was added in **2.25.0**. The tokens/API are still in flux.

#### Notes and gotchas

If the moment that results from the parsed input does not exist, `moment#isValid` will return false.

```
moment("2010 13",           "YYYY MM").isValid();     // false (not a real month)
moment("2010 11 31",        "YYYY MM DD").isValid();  // false (not a real day)
moment("2010 2 29",         "YYYY MM DD").isValid();  // false (not a leap year)
moment("2010 notamonth 29", "YYYY MMM DD").isValid(); // false (not a real month name)
```

As of version **2.0.0**, a locale key can be passed as the third parameter to `moment()` and `moment.utc()`.

```
moment('2012 juillet', 'YYYY MMM', 'fr');
moment('2012 July',    'YYYY MMM', 'en');
moment('2012 July',    'YYYY MMM', ['qj', 'en']);
```

Moment's parser is very forgiving, and this can lead to undesired/unexpected behavior.

For example, the following behavior can be observed:

```
moment('2016 is a date', 'YYYY-MM-DD').isValid() //true, 2016 was matched
```

Previous to **2.13.0** the parser exhibited the following behavior. This has been corrected.

```
moment('I am spartacus', 'h:hh A').isValid();     //true - the 'am' matches the 'A' flag.
```

As of version **2.3.0**, you may specify a boolean for the last argument to make Moment use strict parsing. Strict parsing requires that the format and input match exactly, *including delimeters*.

```
moment('It is 2012-05-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD').isValid();       // true
moment('It is 2012-05-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD', true).isValid(); // false
moment('2012-05-25',       'YYYY-MM-DD', true).isValid(); // true
moment('2012.05.25',       'YYYY-MM-DD', true).isValid(); // false
```

You can use both locale and strictness.

```
moment('2012-10-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'fr', true);
```

Strict parsing is frequently the best parsing option. For more information about choosing strict vs forgiving parsing, see the [parsing guide.](https://momentjs.com/guides/#/parsing/)

#### Parsing two digit years

By default, two digit years above 68 are assumed to be in the 1900's and years 68 or below are assumed to be in the 2000's. This can be changed by replacing the `moment.parseTwoDigitYear` method. The only argument of this method is a string containing the two years input by the user, and should return the year as an integer.

```
moment.parseTwoDigitYear = function(yearString) {
    return parseInt(yearString) + 2000;
}
```

#### Parsing glued hour and minutes

From version **2.11.0** parsing `hmm`, `Hmm`, `hmmss` and `Hmmss` is supported:

```
moment("123", "hmm").format("HH:mm") === "01:23"
moment("1234", "hmm").format("HH:mm") === "12:34"
```

### [String + Formats](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-formats/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/04-string-formats.md)

```
moment(String, String[], String, Boolean);
```

If you don't know the exact format of an input string, but know it could be one of many, you can use an array of formats.

This is the same as [String + Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/), only it will try to match the input to multiple formats.

```
moment("12-25-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY-MM-DD"]);
```

Starting in version **2.3.0**, Moment uses some simple heuristics to determine which format to use. In order:

-   Prefer formats resulting in [valid](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/is-valid/) dates over invalid ones.
-   Prefer formats that parse more of the string than less and use more of the format than less, i.e. prefer stricter parsing.
-   Prefer formats earlier in the array than later.

```
moment("29-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM", "DD-MM-YYYY"]); // uses the last format
moment("05-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"]);          // uses the first format
```

You may also specify a locale and strictness argument. They work the same as the single format case.

```
moment("29-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"], 'fr');       // uses 'fr' locale
moment("29-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"], true);       // uses strict parsing
moment("05-06-1995", ["MM-DD-YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY"], 'fr', true); // uses 'fr' locale and strict parsing
```

**Note:** Parsing multiple formats is considerably slower than parsing a single format. If you can avoid it, it is much faster to parse a single format.

### [Special Formats](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/special-formats/) 2.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/05-special-formats.md)

```
moment(String, moment.CUSTOM_FORMAT, [String], [Boolean]);
moment(String, moment.HTML5_FMT.DATETIME_LOCAL, [String], [Boolean]); // from 2.20.0
moment(String, [..., moment.ISO_8601, ...], [String], [Boolean]);
```

[ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) is a standard for time and duration display. Moment already supports parsing iso-8601 strings, but this can be specified explicitly in the format/list of formats when constructing a moment.

To specify iso-8601 parsing use `moment.ISO_8601` constant.

```
moment("2010-01-01T05:06:07", moment.ISO_8601);
moment("2010-01-01T05:06:07", ["YYYY", moment.ISO_8601]);
```

As of version **2.20.0**, the following HTML5 formats are available as constants in the `moment` object's `HTML5_FMT` property (`moment.HTML5_FMT.*`):

| Constant | Format | Example | Input Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATETIME_LOCAL` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` | 2017-12-14T16:34 | `<input type="datetime-local" />` |
| `DATETIME_LOCAL_SECONDS` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` | 2017-12-14T16:34:10 | `<input type="datetime-local" step="1" />` |
| `DATETIME_LOCAL_MS` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS` | 2017-12-14T16:34:10.234 | `<input type="datetime-local" step="0.001" />` |
| `DATE` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | 2017-12-14 | `<input type="date" />` |
| `TIME` | `HH:mm` | 16:34 | `<input type="time" />` |
| `TIME_SECONDS` | `HH:mm:ss` | 16:34:10 | `<input type="time" step="1" />` |
| `TIME_MS` | `HH:mm:ss.SSS` | 16:34:10.234 | `<input type="time" step="0.001" />` |
| `WEEK` | `GGGG-[W]WW` | 2017-W50 | `<input type="week" />` |
| `MONTH` | `YYYY-MM` | 2017-12 | `<input type="month" />` |

### [Object](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/object/) 2.2.1+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/06-object.md)

```
moment({unit: value, ...});
```

```
moment({ hour:15, minute:10 });
moment({ y    :2010, M     :3, d   :5, h    :15, m      :10, s      :3, ms          :123});
moment({ year :2010, month :3, day :5, hour :15, minute :10, second :3, millisecond :123});
moment({ years:2010, months:3, days:5, hours:15, minutes:10, seconds:3, milliseconds:123});
moment({ years:2010, months:3, date:5, hours:15, minutes:10, seconds:3, milliseconds:123});
moment({ years:'2010', months:'3', date:'5', hours:'15', minutes:'10', seconds:'3', milliseconds:'123'});  // from 2.11.0
```

You can create a moment by specifying some of the units in an object.

Omitted units default to 0 or the current date, month, and year.

`day` and `date` key both mean day-of-the-month.

`date` was added in **2.8.4**.

String values (as shown on the last line) are supported from version **2.11.0**.

Note that like `moment(Array)` and `new Date(year, month, date)`, months are 0 indexed.

### [Unix Timestamp (milliseconds)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/unix-timestamp-milliseconds/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/07-unix-timestamp-milliseconds.md)

Similar to `new Date(Number)`, you can create a moment by passing an integer value representing the number of *milliseconds* since the Unix Epoch (Jan 1 1970 12AM UTC).

```
var day = moment(1318781876406);
```

[Note: ECMAScript calls this a "Time Value"](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-time-values-and-time-range)

### [Unix Timestamp (seconds)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/unix-timestamp/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/08-unix-timestamp.md)

To create a moment from a Unix timestamp (*seconds* since the Unix Epoch), use `moment.unix(Number)`.

```
var day = moment.unix(1318781876);
```

This is implemented as `moment(timestamp * 1000)`, so partial seconds in the input timestamp are included.

```
var day = moment.unix(1318781876.721);
```

**Note:** Despite Unix timestamps being UTC-based, this function creates a moment object in *local* mode. If you need UTC, then subsequently call `.utc()`, as in:

```
var day = moment.unix(1318781876).utc();
```

### [Date](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/date/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/09-date.md)

You can create a `Moment` with a pre-existing native Javascript `Date` object.

```
var day = new Date(2011, 9, 16);
var dayWrapper = moment(day);
```

This clones the `Date` object; further changes to the `Date` won't affect the `Moment`, and vice-versa.

### [Array](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/array/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/10-array.md)

You can create a moment with an array of numbers that mirror the parameters passed to [new Date()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

`[year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond]`

```
moment([2010, 1, 14, 15, 25, 50, 125]); // February 14th, 3:25:50.125 PM
```

Any value past the year is optional, and will default to the lowest possible number.

```
moment([2010]);        // January 1st
moment([2010, 6]);     // July 1st
moment([2010, 6, 10]); // July 10th
```

Construction with an array will create a date in the current time zone. To create a date from an array at UTC, use `moment.utc(Number[])`.

```
moment.utc([2010, 1, 14, 15, 25, 50, 125]);
```

**Note:** Because this mirrors the native `Date` parameters, months, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are all zero indexed. Years and days of the month are 1 indexed.

This is often the cause of frustration, especially with months, so take note!

If the date represented by the array does not exist, `moment#isValid` will return false.

```
moment([2010, 12]).isValid();     // false (not a real month)
moment([2010, 10, 31]).isValid(); // false (not a real day)
moment([2010, 1, 29]).isValid();  // false (not a leap year)
```

### [ASP.NET JSON Date](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/asp-net-json-date/) 1.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/11-asp-net-json-date.md)

Microsoft Web API returns JSON dates in proper ISO-8601 format by default, but older ASP.NET technologies may return dates in JSON as `/Date(1198908717056)/` or `/Date(1198908717056-0700)/`

If a string that matches this format is passed in, it will be parsed correctly.

```
moment("/Date(1198908717056-0700)/"); // 2007-12-28T23:11:57.056-07:00
```

### [Moment Clone](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/moment-clone/) 1.2.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/12-moment-clone.md)

All moments are mutable. If you want a clone of a moment, you can do so implicitly or explicitly.

Calling `moment()` on a moment will clone it.

```
var a = moment([2012]);
var b = moment(a);
a.year(2000);
b.year(); // 2012
```

Additionally, you can call `moment#clone` to clone a moment.

```
var a = moment([2012]);
var b = a.clone();
a.year(2000);
b.year(); // 2012
```

### [UTC](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/utc/) 1.5.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/13-utc.md)

```
moment.utc();
moment.utc(Number);
moment.utc(Number[]);
moment.utc(String);
moment.utc(String, String);
moment.utc(String, String[]);
moment.utc(String, String, String);
moment.utc(String, String, String[]);
moment.utc(String, String, Boolean);
moment.utc(String, String, String, Boolean);
moment.utc(Moment);
moment.utc(Date);
```

By default, moment parses and displays in local time.

If you want to parse or display a moment in UTC, you can use `moment.utc()` instead of `moment()`.

This brings us to an interesting feature of Moment.js. UTC mode.

While in UTC mode, all display methods will display in UTC time instead of local time.

```
moment().format();     // 2013-02-04T10:35:24-08:00
moment.utc().format(); // 2013-02-04T18:35:24+00:00
```

Additionally, while in UTC mode, all getters and setters will internally use the `Date#getUTC*` and `Date#setUTC*` methods instead of the `Date#get*` and `Date#set*` methods.

```
moment.utc().seconds(30).valueOf() === new Date().setUTCSeconds(30);
moment.utc().seconds()   === new Date().getUTCSeconds();
```

It is important to note that though the displays differ above, they are both the same moment in time.

```
var a = moment();
var b = moment.utc();
a.format();  // 2013-02-04T10:35:24-08:00
b.format();  // 2013-02-04T18:35:24+00:00
a.valueOf(); // 1360002924000
b.valueOf(); // 1360002924000
```

Any moment created with `moment.utc()` will be in UTC mode, and any moment created with `moment()` will not.

To switch from UTC to local time, you can use [moment#utc](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/utc/) or [moment#local](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/local/).

```
var a = moment.utc([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
a.hours(); // 8 UTC
a.local();
a.hours(); // 0 PST
```

### [parseZone](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/parse-zone/) 2.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/14-parse-zone.md)

```
moment.parseZone()
moment.parseZone(String)
moment.parseZone(String, String)
moment.parseZone(String, [String])
moment.parseZone(String, String, Boolean)
moment.parseZone(String, String, String, Boolean)
```

Moment's string parsing functions like `moment(string)` and `moment.utc(string)` accept offset information if provided, but convert the resulting Moment object to local or UTC time. In contrast, `moment.parseZone()` parses the string but keeps the resulting Moment object in a fixed-offset timezone with the provided offset in the string.

```
moment.parseZone("2013-01-01T00:00:00-13:00").utcOffset(); // -780 ("-13:00" in total minutes)
moment.parseZone('2013 01 01 05 -13:00', 'YYYY MM DD HH ZZ').utcOffset(); // -780  ("-13:00" in total minutes)
moment.parseZone('2013-01-01-13:00', ['DD MM YYYY ZZ', 'YYYY MM DD ZZ']).utcOffset(); // -780  ("-13:00" in total minutes);
```

It also allows you to pass locale and strictness arguments.

```
moment.parseZone("2013 01 01 -13:00", 'YYYY MM DD ZZ', true).utcOffset(); // -780  ("-13:00" in total minutes)
moment.parseZone("2013-01-01-13:00", 'YYYY MM DD ZZ', true).utcOffset(); // NaN (doesn't pass the strictness check)
moment.parseZone("2013 01 01 -13:00", 'YYYY MM DD ZZ', 'fr', true).utcOffset(); // -780 (with locale and strictness argument)
moment.parseZone("2013 01 01 -13:00", ['DD MM YYYY ZZ', 'YYYY MM DD ZZ'], 'fr', true).utcOffset(); // -780 (with locale and strictness argument alongside an array of formats)
```

`moment.parseZone` is equivalent to parsing the string and using `moment#utcOffset` to parse the zone.

```
var s = "2013-01-01T00:00:00-13:00";
moment(s).utcOffset(s);
```

### [Validation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/is-valid/) 1.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/15-is-valid.md)

Moment applies stricter initialization rules than the `Date` constructor.

```
new Date(2013, 25, 14).toString(); // "Sat Feb 14 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST)"
moment([2015, 25, 35]).format();   // 'Invalid date'
```

You can check whether the Moment considers the date invalid using `moment#isValid`. You can check the metrics used by `#isValid` using `moment#parsingFlags`, which returns an object.

The following parsing flags result in an invalid date:

-   `overflow`: An overflow of a date field, such as a 13th month, a 32nd day of the month (or a 29th of February on non-leap years), a 367th day of the year, etc. `overflow` contains the index of the invalid unit to match `#invalidAt` (see below); `-1` means no overflow.
-   `invalidMonth`: An invalid month name, such as `moment('Marbruary', 'MMMM');`. Contains the invalid month string itself, or else null.
-   `empty`: An input string that contains nothing parsable, such as `moment('this is nonsense');`. Boolean.
-   `nullInput`: A `null` input, like `moment(null);`. Boolean.
-   `invalidFormat`: An empty list of formats, such as `moment('2013-05-25', [])`. Boolean.
-   `userInvalidated`: A date created explicitly as invalid, such as `moment.invalid()`. Boolean.

In addition to the above, As of **2.13.0** the meridiem and parsedDateParts flags work together to determine date validity.

-   `meridiem`: Indicates what meridiem (AM/PM) was parsed, if any. String.
-   `parsedDateParts`: Returns an array of date parts parsed in descending order - i.e. parsedDateParts\[0\] === year. If no parts are present, but meridiem has value, date is invalid. Array.

Additionally, if the Moment is parsed in strict mode, these flags must be empty for the Moment to be valid:

-   `unusedTokens`: array of format substrings not found in the input string
-   `unusedInput`: array of input substrings not matched to the format string

**Note:** Moment's concept of validity became more strict and consistent between **2.2** and **2.3**. **Note:** Validity is determined on moment creation. A modified moment (i.e. `moment().hour(NaN)`) will remain valid.

Additionally, you can use `moment#invalidAt` to determine which date unit overflowed.

```
var m = moment("2011-10-10T10:20:90");
m.isValid(); // false
m.invalidAt(); // 5 for seconds
```

The return value has the following meaning:

1.  years
2.  months
3.  days
4.  hours
5.  minutes
6.  seconds
7.  milliseconds

**Note:** In case of multiple wrong units the first one is returned (because days validity may depend on month, for example).

## Invalid Moments

If a moment is invalid, it behaves like a NaN in floating point operations.

All of the following produce invalid moments:

-   `invalid.add(unit, value)`
-   `another.add(invalid)`
-   `invalid.clone()`
-   `invalid.diff(another)`
-   `invalid.endOf(unit)`
-   `invalid.max(another)`
-   `another.max(invalid)`
-   `invalid.min(another)`
-   `another.min(invalid)`
-   `invalid.set(unit, value)`
-   `invalid.startOf(unit)`
-   `invalid.subtract(unit, value)`

The following produce a localized version of `'InvalidDate'`:

-   `invalid.format(anyFmt)` results in `'Invalid Date'` in the current locale
-   `invalid.from(another)`
-   `another.from(invalid)`
-   `invalid.fromNow(suffix)`
-   `invalid.to(another)`
-   `another.to(invalid)`
-   `invalid.toNow(suffix)`
-   `invalid.toISOString()` (Before **2.18.0**)
-   `invalid.toString()`

The following return `false`:

-   `invalid.isAfter(another)`
-   `invalid.isAfter(invalid)`
-   `another.isAfter(invalid)`
-   `invalid.isBefore(another)`
-   `invalid.isBefore(invalid)`
-   `another.isBefore(invalid)`
-   `invalid.isBetween(another, another)`
-   `invalid.isBetween(invalid, invalid)`
-   `invalid.isSame(another)`
-   `invalid.isSame(invalid)`
-   `another.isSame(invalid)`
-   `invalid.isSameOrAfter(another)`
-   `invalid.isSameOrAfter(invalid)`
-   `another.isSameOrAfter(invalid)`
-   `invalid.isSameOrBefore(another)`
-   `invalid.isSameOrBefore(invalid)`
-   `another.isSameOrBefore(invalid)`

And these return `null` or `NaN` with some structure:

-   `invalid.get(unit)` returns null, as all other named getters
-   `invalid.toArray() === [NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN]`
-   `invalid.toObject()` has all values set to `NaN`
-   `invalid.toDate()` returns an invalid Date object
-   `invalid.toJSON()` returns null
-   `invalid.unix()` returns null
-   `invalid.valueOf()` returns null
-   `invalid.toISOString()` returns null (As of **2.18.0**)

### [Creation Data](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/creation-data/) 2.11.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/16-creation-data.md)

After a moment object is created, all of the inputs can be accessed with `creationData()` method:

```
moment("2013-01-02", "YYYY-MM-DD", true).creationData() === {
    input: "2013-01-02",
    format: "YYYY-MM-DD",
    locale: Locale obj,
    isUTC: false,
    strict: true
}
```

### [Defaults](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/defaults/) 2.2.1+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/01-parsing/17-defaults.md)

You can create a moment object specifying only some of the units, and the rest will be defaulted to the current day, month or year, or 0 for hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.

Defaulting to now, when nothing is passed:

```
moment();  // current date and time
```

Defaulting to today, when only hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds are passed:

```
moment(5, "HH");  // today, 5:00:00.000
moment({hour: 5});  // today, 5:00:00.000
moment({hour: 5, minute: 10});  // today, 5:10.00.000
moment({hour: 5, minute: 10, seconds: 20});  // today, 5:10.20.000
moment({hour: 5, minute: 10, seconds: 20, milliseconds: 300});  // today, 5:10.20.300
```

Defaulting to this month and year, when only days and smaller units are passed:

```
moment(5, "DD");  // this month, 5th day-of-month
moment("4 05:06:07", "DD hh:mm:ss");  // this month, 4th day-of-month, 05:06:07.000
```

Defaulting to this year, if year is not specified:

```
moment(3, "MM");  // this year, 3rd month (March)
moment("Apr 4 05:06:07", "MMM DD hh:mm:ss");  // this year, 4th April, 05:06:07.000
```

## [Get + Set](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/)

Moment.js uses overloaded getters and setters. You may be familiar with this pattern from its use in jQuery.

Calling these methods without parameters acts as a getter, and calling them with a parameter acts as a setter.

These map to the corresponding function on the native `Date` object.

```
moment().seconds(30).valueOf() === new Date().setSeconds(30);
moment().seconds()   === new Date().getSeconds();
```

If you are in [UTC mode](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/utc/), they will map to the UTC equivalent.

```
moment.utc().seconds(30).valueOf() === new Date().setUTCSeconds(30);
moment.utc().seconds()   === new Date().getUTCSeconds();
```

For convenience, both singular and plural method names exist as of version **2.0.0**.

**Note:** All of these methods mutate the original moment when used as setters.

**Note:** From **2.19.0** passing `NaN` to any setter is a no-op. Before **2.19.0** it was invalidating the moment in a wrong way.

### [Millisecond](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/millisecond/) 1.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/01-millisecond.md)

```
moment().millisecond(Number);
moment().millisecond(); // Number
moment().milliseconds(Number);
moment().milliseconds(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the milliseconds.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 999. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the seconds.

### [Second](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/second/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/02-second.md)

```
moment().second(Number);
moment().second(); // Number
moment().seconds(Number);
moment().seconds(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the seconds.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 59. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the minutes.

### [Minute](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/minute/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/03-minute.md)

```
moment().minute(Number);
moment().minute(); // Number
moment().minutes(Number);
moment().minutes(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the minutes.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 59. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the hour.

### [Hour](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/hour/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/04-hour.md)

```
moment().hour(Number);
moment().hour(); // Number
moment().hours(Number);
moment().hours(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the hour.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 23. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the day.

### [Date of Month](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/date/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/05-date.md)

```
moment().date(Number);
moment().date(); // Number
moment().dates(Number);
moment().dates(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the day of the month.

Accepts numbers from 1 to 31. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the months.

**Note:** `Moment#date` is for the date of the month, and `Moment#day` is for the day of the week.

**Note:** if you chain multiple actions to construct a date, you should start from a year, then a month, then a day etc. Otherwise you may get unexpected results, like when `day=31` and current month has only 30 days (the same applies to native JavaScript `Date` manipulation), the returned date will be the 30th of the current month (see [month](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/month/) for more details).

Bad: `moment().date(day).month(month).year(year)`

Good: `moment().year(year).month(month).date(day)`

**2.16.0** deprecated using `moment().dates()`. Use `moment().date()` instead.

### [Day of Week](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/day/) 1.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/06-day.md)

```
moment().day(Number|String);
moment().day(); // Number
moment().days(Number|String);
moment().days(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the day of the week.

This method can be used to set the day of the week, with Sunday as 0 and Saturday as 6.

If the value given is from 0 to 6, the resulting date will be within the current (Sunday-to-Saturday) week.

If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to other weeks.

```
moment().day(-7); // last Sunday (0 - 7)
moment().day(0); // this Sunday (0)
moment().day(7); // next Sunday (0 + 7)
moment().day(10); // next Wednesday (3 + 7)
moment().day(24); // 3 Wednesdays from now (3 + 7 + 7 + 7)
```

**Note:** `Moment#date` is for the date of the month, and `Moment#day` is for the day of the week.

As of **2.1.0**, a day name is also supported. This is parsed in the moment's current locale.

```
moment().day("Sunday");
moment().day("Monday");
```

### [Day of Week (Locale Aware)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/weekday/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/07-weekday.md)

```
moment().weekday(Number);
moment().weekday(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the day of the week according to the locale.

If the locale assigns Monday as the first day of the week, `moment().weekday(0)` will be Monday. If Sunday is the first day of the week, `moment().weekday(0)` will be Sunday.

As with `moment#day`, if the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to other weeks.

```
// when Monday is the first day of the week
moment().weekday(-7); // last Monday
moment().weekday(7); // next Monday
// when Sunday is the first day of the week
moment().weekday(-7); // last Sunday
moment().weekday(7); // next Sunday
```

### [ISO Day of Week](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/iso-weekday/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/08-iso-weekday.md)

```
moment().isoWeekday(Number);
moment().isoWeekday(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the [ISO day of the week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) with `1` being Monday and `7` being Sunday.

As with `moment#day`, if the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to other weeks.

```
moment().isoWeekday(1); // Monday
moment().isoWeekday(7); // Sunday
```

A day name is also supported. This is parsed in the moment's current locale.

```
moment().isoWeekday("Sunday");
moment().isoWeekday("Monday");
```

### [Day of Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/day-of-year/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/09-day-of-year.md)

```
moment().dayOfYear(Number);
moment().dayOfYear(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the day of the year.

Accepts numbers from 1 to 366. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the years.

### [Week of Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/week/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/10-week.md)

```
moment().week(Number);
moment().week(); // Number
moment().weeks(Number);
moment().weeks(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the week of the year.

Because different locales define week of year numbering differently, Moment.js added `moment#week` to get/set the localized week of the year.

The week of the year varies depending on which day is the first day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc), and which week is the first week of the year.

For example, in the United States, Sunday is the first day of the week. The week with January 1st in it is the first week of the year.

In France, Monday is the first day of the week, and the week with January 4th is the first week of the year.

The output of `moment#week` will depend on the [locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n) for that moment.

When setting the week of the year, the day of the week is retained.

### [Week of Year (ISO)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/iso-week/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/11-iso-week.md)

```
moment().isoWeek(Number);
moment().isoWeek(); // Number
moment().isoWeeks(Number);
moment().isoWeeks(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the [ISO week of the year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

When setting the week of the year, the day of the week is retained.

### [Month](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/month/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/12-month.md)

```
moment().month(Number|String);
moment().month(); // Number
moment().months(Number|String);
moment().months(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the month.

Accepts numbers from 0 to 11. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the year.

**Note:** Months are zero indexed, so January is month 0.

As of **2.1.0**, a month name is also supported. This is parsed in the moment's current locale.

```
moment().month("January");
moment().month("Feb");
```

Before version **2.1.0**, if a moment changed months and the new month did not have enough days to keep the current day of month, it would overflow to the next month.

As of version **2.1.0**, this was changed to be clamped to the end of the target month.

```
// before 2.1.0
moment([2012, 0, 31]).month(1).format("YYYY-MM-DD"); // 2012-03-02
// after 2.1.0
moment([2012, 0, 31]).month(1).format("YYYY-MM-DD"); // 2012-02-29
```

**2.16.0** deprecated using `moment().months()`. Use `moment().month()` instead.

### [Quarter](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/quarter/) 2.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/13-quarter.md)

```
moment().quarter(); // Number
moment().quarter(Number);
moment().quarters(); // Number
moment().quarters(Number);
```

Gets the quarter (1 to 4).

```
moment('2013-01-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 1
moment('2013-04-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 1
moment('2013-04-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 2
moment('2013-07-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 2
moment('2013-07-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 3
moment('2013-10-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 3
moment('2013-10-01T00:00:00.000').quarter() // 4
moment('2014-01-01T00:00:00.000').subtract(1, 'ms').quarter() // 4
```

Sets the quarter (1 to 4).

```
moment('2013-01-01T00:00:00.000').quarter(2) // '2013-04-01T00:00:00.000'
moment('2013-02-05T05:06:07.000').quarter(2).format() // '2013-05-05T05:06:07-07:00'
```

### [Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/year/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/14-year.md)

```
moment().year(Number);
moment().year(); // Number
moment().years(Number);
moment().years(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the year.

Accepts numbers from -270,000 to 270,000.

**2.6.0** deprecated using `moment().years()`. Use `moment().year()` instead.

### [Week Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/week-year/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/15-week-year.md)

```
moment().weekYear(Number);
moment().weekYear(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the week-year according to the locale.

Because the first day of the first week does not always fall on the first day of the year, sometimes the week-year will differ from the month year.

For example, in the US, the week that contains Jan 1 is always the first week. In the US, weeks also start on Sunday. If Jan 1 was a Monday, Dec 31 would belong to the same week as Jan 1, and thus the same week-year as Jan 1. Dec 30 would have a different week-year than Dec 31.

### [Week Year (ISO)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/iso-week-year/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/16-iso-week-year.md)

```
moment().isoWeekYear(Number);
moment().isoWeekYear(); // Number
```

Gets or sets the [ISO week-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

### [Weeks In Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/weeks-in-year/) 2.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/17-weeks-in-year.md)

Gets the number of weeks according to locale in the current moment's year.

### [Weeks In Year (ISO)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/iso-weeks-in-year/) 2.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/18-iso-weeks-in-year.md)

```
moment().isoWeeksInYear();
```

Gets the number of weeks in the current moment's year, according to [ISO weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

### [Get](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/get/) 2.2.1+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/19-get.md)

```
moment().get('year');
moment().get('month');  // 0 to 11
moment().get('date');
moment().get('hour');
moment().get('minute');
moment().get('second');
moment().get('millisecond');
```

String getter. In general

```
moment().get(unit) === moment()[unit]()
```

Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms: year (years, y), month (months, M), date (dates, D), hour (hours, h), minute (minutes, m), second (seconds, s), millisecond (milliseconds, ms).

### [Set](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/set/) 2.2.1+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/20-set.md)

```
moment().set(String, Int);
moment().set(Object(String, Int));
```

Generic setter, accepting unit as first argument, and value as second:

```
moment().set('year', 2013);
moment().set('month', 3);  // April
moment().set('date', 1);
moment().set('hour', 13);
moment().set('minute', 20);
moment().set('second', 30);
moment().set('millisecond', 123);

moment().set({'year': 2013, 'month': 3});
```

Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms: year (years, y), month (months, M), date (dates, D), hour (hours, h), minute (minutes, m), second (seconds, s), millisecond (milliseconds, ms).

Object parsing was added in **2.9.0**

### [Maximum](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/max/) 2.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/21-max.md)

```
moment.max(Moment[,Moment...]);
moment.max(Moment[]);
```

Returns the maximum (most distant future) of the given moment instances.

For example:

```
var a = moment().subtract(1, 'day');
var b = moment().add(1, 'day');
moment.max(a, b);  // b

var friends = fetchFriends(); /* [{name: 'Dan', birthday: '11.12.1977'}, {name: 'Mary', birthday: '11.12.1986'}, {name: 'Stephan', birthday: '11.01.1993'}]*/
var friendsBirthDays = friends.map(function(friend){
    return moment(friend.birthday, 'DD.MM.YYYY');
});
moment.max(friendsBirthDays);  // '11.01.1993'
```

With no arguments the function returns a moment instance with the current time.

From version **2.10.5**, if an invalid moment is one of the arguments, the result is an invalid moment.

```
moment.max(moment(), moment.invalid()).isValid() === false
moment.max(moment.invalid(), moment()).isValid() === false
moment.max([moment(), moment.invalid()]).isValid() === false
moment.max([moment.invalid(), moment()]).isValid() === false
```

### [Minimum](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/min/) 2.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/02-get-set/22-min.md)

```
moment.min(Moment[,Moment...]);
moment.min(Moment[]);
```

Returns the minimum (most distant past) of the given moment instances.

For example:

```
var a = moment().subtract(1, 'day');
var b = moment().add(1, 'day');
moment.min(a, b);  // a
moment.min([a, b]); // a
```

With no arguments the function returns a moment instance with the current time.

From version **2.10.5**, if an invalid moment is one of the arguments, the result is an invalid moment.

```
moment.min(moment(), moment.invalid()).isValid() === false
moment.min(moment.invalid(), moment()).isValid() === false
moment.min([moment(), moment.invalid()]).isValid() === false
moment.min([moment.invalid(), moment()]).isValid() === false
```

## [Manipulate](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/)

Once you have a `Moment`, you may want to manipulate it in some way. There are a number of methods to help with this.

Moment.js uses the [fluent interface pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface), also known as [method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining). This allows you to do crazy things like the following.

```
moment().add(7, 'days').subtract(1, 'months').year(2009).hours(0).minutes(0).seconds(0);
```

**Note:** It should be noted that moments are mutable. Calling any of the manipulation methods will change the original moment.

If you want to create a copy and manipulate it, you should use `moment#clone` before manipulating the moment. [More info on cloning.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/moment-clone/)

### [Add](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/01-add.md)

```
moment().add(Number, String);
moment().add(Duration);
moment().add(Object);
```

Mutates the original moment by adding time.

This is a pretty robust function for adding time to an existing moment. To add time, pass the key of what time you want to add, and the amount you want to add.

```
moment().add(7, 'days');
```

There are some shorthand keys as well if you're into that whole brevity thing.

```
moment().add(7, 'd');
```

| Key | Shorthand |
| --- | --- |
| years | y |
| quarters | Q |
| months | M |
| weeks | w |
| days | d |
| hours | h |
| minutes | m |
| seconds | s |
| milliseconds | ms |

If you want to add multiple different keys at the same time, you can pass them in as an object literal.

```
moment().add(7, 'days').add(1, 'months'); // with chaining
moment().add({days:7,months:1}); // with object literal
```

There are no upper limits for the amounts, so you can overload any of the parameters.

```
moment().add(1000000, 'milliseconds'); // a million milliseconds
moment().add(360, 'days'); // 360 days
```

#### Special considerations for months and years

If the day of the month on the original date is greater than the number of days in the final month, the day of the month will change to the last day in the final month.

```
moment([2010, 0, 31]);                  // January 31
moment([2010, 0, 31]).add(1, 'months'); // February 28
```

There are also special considerations to keep in mind when adding time that crosses over daylight saving time. If you are adding years, months, weeks, or days, the original hour will always match the added hour.

Adding a month will add the specified number of months to the date.

```
moment([2010, 1, 28]);                 // February 28
moment([2010, 1, 28]).add(1, 'month'); // March 28
```

```
var m = moment(new Date(2011, 2, 12, 5, 0, 0)); // the day before DST in the US
m.hours(); // 5
m.add(1, 'days').hours(); // 5
```

If you are adding hours, minutes, seconds, or milliseconds, the assumption is that you want precision to the hour, and will result in a different hour.

```
var m = moment(new Date(2011, 2, 12, 5, 0, 0)); // the day before DST in the US
m.hours(); // 5
m.add(24, 'hours').hours(); // 6 (but you may have to set the timezone first)
```

Alternatively, you can use [durations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/) to add to moments.

```
var duration = moment.duration({'days' : 1});
moment([2012, 0, 31]).add(duration); // February 1
```

Before version **2.8.0**, the `moment#add(String, Number)` syntax was also supported. It has been deprecated in favor of `moment#add(Number, String)`.

```
moment().add('seconds', 1); // Deprecated in 2.8.0
moment().add(1, 'seconds');
```

As of **2.12.0** when decimal values are passed for days and months, they are rounded to the nearest integer. Weeks, quarters, and years are converted to days or months, and then rounded to the nearest integer.

```
moment().add(1.5, 'months') == moment().add(2, 'months')
moment().add(.7, 'years') == moment().add(8, 'months') //.7*12 = 8.4, rounded to 8
```

### [Subtract](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/subtract/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/02-subtract.md)

```
moment().subtract(Number, String);
moment().subtract(Duration);
moment().subtract(Object);
```

Mutates the original moment by subtracting time.

This is exactly the same as `moment#add`, only instead of adding time, it subtracts time.

```
moment().subtract(7, 'days');
```

Before version **2.8.0**, the `moment#subtract(String, Number)` syntax was also supported. It has been deprecated in favor of `moment#subtract(Number, String)`.

```
moment().subtract('seconds', 1); // Deprecated in 2.8.0
moment().subtract(1, 'seconds');
```

As of **2.12.0** when decimal values are passed for days and months, they are rounded to the nearest integer. Weeks, quarters, and years are converted to days or months, and then rounded to the nearest integer.

```
moment().subtract(1.5, 'months') == moment().subtract(2, 'months')
moment().subtract(.7, 'years') == moment().subtract(8, 'months') //.7*12 = 8.4, rounded to 8
```

Note that in order to make the operations `moment.add(-.5, 'days')` and `moment.subtract(.5, 'days')` equivalent, -.5, -1.5, -2.5, etc are rounded down.

### [Start of Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/start-of/) 1.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/03-start-of.md)

```
moment().startOf(String);
```

Mutates the original moment by setting it to the start of a unit of time.

```
moment().startOf('year');    // set to January 1st, 12:00 am this year
moment().startOf('month');   // set to the first of this month, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('quarter');  // set to the beginning of the current quarter, 1st day of months, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('week');    // set to the first day of this week, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('isoWeek'); // set to the first day of this week according to ISO 8601, 12:00 am
moment().startOf('day');     // set to 12:00 am today
moment().startOf('date');     // set to 12:00 am today
moment().startOf('hour');    // set to now, but with 0 mins, 0 secs, and 0 ms
moment().startOf('minute');  // set to now, but with 0 seconds and 0 milliseconds
moment().startOf('second');  // same as moment().milliseconds(0);
```

These shortcuts are essentially the same as the following.

```
moment().startOf('year');
moment().month(0).date(1).hours(0).minutes(0).seconds(0).milliseconds(0);
```

```
moment().startOf('hour');
moment().minutes(0).seconds(0).milliseconds(0)
```

As of version **2.0.0**, `moment#startOf('day')` replaced `moment#sod`.

**Note:** `moment#startOf('week')` was added in version **2.0.0**.

As of version **2.1.0**, `moment#startOf('week')` uses the locale aware week start day.

**Note:** `moment#startOf('isoWeek')` was added in version **2.2.0**.

**Note:** `moment#startOf('date')` was added as an alias for day in **2.13.0**

### [End of Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/end-of/) 1.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/04-end-of.md)

Mutates the original moment by setting it to the end of a unit of time.

This is the same as `moment#startOf`, only instead of setting to the start of a unit of time, it sets to the end of a unit of time.

```
moment().endOf("year"); // set the moment to 12-31 23:59:59.999 this year
```

As of version **2.0.0**, `moment#endOf('day')` replaced `moment#eod`.

**Note:** `moment#endOf('week')` was added in version **2.0.0**.

As of version **2.1.0**, `moment#endOf('week')` uses the locale aware week start day.

### [Maximum](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/max/) From 2.1.0, Deprecated 2.7.0

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/05-max.md)

```
moment().max(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
```

**Note:** This function has been **deprecated** in **2.7.0**. Consider [`moment.min`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/min/) instead.

---

Limits the moment to a maximum of another moment value. So `a.max(b)` is the same as `a = moment.min(a, b)` (note that `max` is converted to `min`).

Sometimes, server clocks are not quite in sync with client clocks. This ends up displaying humanized strings such as "in a few seconds" rather than "a few seconds ago". You can prevent that with `moment#max()`:

This is the counterpart for `moment#min`.

```
var momentFromServer = moment(input);
var clampedMoment = momentFromServer.max();
```

You can pass anything to `moment#max` that you would pass to `moment()`.

```
moment().max(moment().add(1, 'd'));
moment().max("2013-04-20T20:00:00+0800");
moment().max("Jan 1 2001", "MMM D YYYY");
moment().max(new Date(2012, 1, 8));
```

### [Minimum](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/min/) From 2.1.0, Deprecated 2.7.0

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/06-min.md)

```
moment().min(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
```

**Note:** This function has been **deprecated** in **2.7.0**. Consider [`moment.max`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/max/) instead.

---

Limits the moment to a minimum of another moment value. So `a.min(b)` is the same as `a = moment.max(a, b)` (note that `min` is converted to `max`).

This is the counterpart for `moment#max`.

```
moment().min("2013-04-20T20:00:00+0800");
```

This can be used in conjunction with `moment#max` to clamp a moment to a range.

```
var start  = moment().startOf('week');
var end    = moment().endOf('week');
var actual = moment().min(start).max(end);
```

### [Local](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/local/) 1.5.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/07-local.md)

```
moment().local();
moment().local(Boolean); // from 2.8.0
```

Sets a flag on the original moment to use local time to display a moment instead of the original moment's time.

```
var a = moment.utc([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
a.hours(); // 8 UTC
a.local();
a.hours(); // 0 PST
```

Local can also be used to convert out of a fixed offset mode:

```
moment.parseZone('2016-05-03T22:15:01+02:00').local().format(); // "2016-05-03T15:15:01-05:00"
```

Passing `true` will change the time zone without changing the current time.

```
moment.parseZone('2016-05-03T22:15:01+02:00').local(true).format(); //"2016-05-03T22:15:01-05:00"
```

See [moment.utc()](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/utc/) for more information on UTC mode.

### [UTC](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/utc/) 1.5.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/08-utc.md)

```
moment().utc();
moment().utc(Boolean); // from 2.8.0
```

Sets a flag on the original moment to use UTC to display a moment instead of the original moment's time.

```
var a = moment([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
a.hours(); // 8 PST
a.utc();
a.hours(); // 16 UTC
```

UTC can also be used to convert out of a fixed offset mode:

```
moment.parseZone('2016-05-03T22:15:01+02:00').utc().format(); //"2016-05-03T20:15:01Z"
```

Passing `true` will change the time zone without changing the current time.

```
moment.parseZone('2016-05-03T22:15:01+02:00').utc(true).format(); //"2016-05-03T22:15:01Z"
```

See [moment.utc()](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/utc/) for more information on UTC mode.

### [UTC offset](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/utc-offset/) 2.9.0++

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/09-utc-offset.md)

```
moment().utcOffset();
moment().utcOffset(Number|String);
moment().utcOffset(Number|String, Boolean);
```

Get or set the UTC offset in minutes.

**Note:** Unlike [`moment.fn.zone`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/timezone-offset/) this function returns the real offset from UTC, not the reverse offset (as returned by `Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset`).

Getting the `utcOffset` of the current object:

```
moment().utcOffset(); // (-240, -120, -60, 0, 60, 120, 240, etc.)
```

Setting the UTC offset by supplying minutes. The offset is set on the moment object that `utcOffset()` is called on. If you are wanting to set the offset globally, try using [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/). Note that once you set an offset, it's fixed and won't change on its own (i.e there are no DST rules). If you want an actual time zone -- time in a particular location, like `America/Los_Angeles`, consider [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).

```
moment().utcOffset(120);
```

If the input is less than `16` and greater than `-16`, it will interpret your input as hours instead.

```
// these are equivalent
moment().utcOffset(8);  // set hours offset
moment().utcOffset(480);  // set minutes offset (8 * 60)
```

It is also possible to set the UTC offset from a string.

```
// these are equivalent
moment().utcOffset("+08:00");
moment().utcOffset(8);
moment().utcOffset(480);
```

`moment#utcOffset` will search the string for the last match of `+00 -00 +00:00 +0000 -00:00 -0000 Z`, so you can even pass an ISO8601 formatted string with offset and the moment will be changed to that UTC offset.

Note that if the string does not include 'Z', it must include the `+` or `-` character.

```
moment().utcOffset("2013-03-07T07:00:00+08:00");
```

The `utcOffset` function has an optional second parameter which accepts a boolean value indicating whether to keep the existing time of day.

-   Passing `false` (the default) will keep the same instant in Universal Time, but the local time will change.
    
-   Passing `true` will keep the same local time, but at the expense of choosing a different point in Universal Time.
    

One use of this feature is if you want to construct a moment with a specific time zone offset using only numeric input values:

```
moment([2016, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]).utcOffset(-5, true) // Equivalent to "2016-01-01T00:00:00-05:00"
```

### [Time zone Offset](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/timezone-offset/) From 1.2.0, deprecated 2.9.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/03-manipulating/10-timezone-offset.md)

```
moment().zone();
moment().zone(Number|String);
```

**Note:** This function has been **deprecated** in **2.9.0**. Consider [`moment.fn.utcOffset`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/utc-offset/) instead.

Get the time zone offset in minutes.

```
moment().zone(); // (60, 120, 240, etc.)
```

As of version **2.1.0**, it is possible to set the offset by passing in the number of minutes offset from GMT.

```
moment().zone(120);
```

If the input is less than `16` and greater than `-16`, it will interpret your input as hours instead.

```
// these are equivalent
moment().zone(480);
moment().zone(8);
```

It is also possible to set the zone from a string.

```
moment().zone("-08:00");
```

`moment#zone` will search the string for the first match of `+00:00 +0000 -00:00 -0000`, so you can even pass an ISO8601 formatted string and the moment will be changed to that zone.

```
moment().zone("2013-03-07T07:00:00-08:00");
```

## [Display](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/)

Once parsing and manipulation are done, you need some way to display the moment.

### [Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/01-format.md)

```
moment().format();
moment().format(String);
```

This is the most robust display option. It takes a string of tokens and replaces them with their corresponding values.

```
moment().format();                                // "2014-09-08T08:02:17-05:00" (ISO 8601, no fractional seconds)
moment().format("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a"); // "Sunday, February 14th 2010, 3:25:50 pm"
moment().format("ddd, hA");                       // "Sun, 3PM"
moment().format("[Today is] dddd");               // "Today is Sunday"
moment('gibberish').format('YYYY MM DD');         // "Invalid date"
```

|  | Z | \-07:00 -06:00 ... +06:00 +07:00 |
|  | ZZ | \-0700 -0600 ... +0600 +0700 |
| **Unix Timestamp** | X | 1360013296 |
| **Unix Millisecond Timestamp** | x | 1360013296123 |

`X` was added in **2.0.0**.

`e E gg gggg GG GGGG` were added in **2.1.0**.

`x` was added in **2.8.4**.

`SSSS` to `SSSSSSSSS` were added in **2.10.5**. They display 3 significant digits and the rest is filled with zeros.

`k` and `kk` were added in **2.13.0**.

#### Localized formats

Because preferred formatting differs based on locale, there are a few tokens that can be used to format a moment based on its locale.

There are upper and lower case variations on the same formats. The lowercase version is intended to be the shortened version of its uppercase counterpart.

| **Time** | LT | 8:30 PM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Time with seconds** | LTS | 8:30:25 PM |
| **Month numeral, day of month, year** | L | 09/04/1986 |
|  | l | 9/4/1986 |
| **Month name, day of month, year** | LL | September 4, 1986 |
|  | ll | Sep 4, 1986 |
| **Month name, day of month, year, time** | LLL | September 4, 1986 8:30 PM |
|  | lll | Sep 4, 1986 8:30 PM |
| **Month name, day of month, day of week, year, time** | LLLL | Thursday, September 4, 1986 8:30 PM |
|  | llll | Thu, Sep 4, 1986 8:30 PM |

`l ll lll llll` are available in **2.0.0**. `LTS` was added in **2.8.4**.

#### Escaping characters

To escape characters in format strings, you can wrap the characters in square brackets.

```
moment().format('[today] dddd'); // 'today Sunday'
```

#### Similarities and differences with LDML

**Note:** While these date formats are very similar to LDML date formats, there are a few minor differences regarding day of month, day of year, and day of week.

For a breakdown of a few different date formatting tokens across different locales, see [this chart of date formatting tokens.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtgZluze7WMJdDBOLUZfSFIzenIwOHNjaWZoeGFqbWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0)

#### Other tokens

If you are more comfortable working with strftime instead of LDML-like parsing tokens, you can use Ben Oakes' plugin. [benjaminoakes/moment-strftime](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/moment-strftime).

#### Default format

Calling `moment#format` without a format will default to `moment.defaultFormat`. Out of the box, `moment.defaultFormat` is the ISO8601 format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`.

As of version **2.13.0**, when in UTC mode, the default format is governed by `moment.defaultFormatUtc` which is in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss[Z]`. This returns `Z` as the offset, instead of `+00:00`.

In certain instances, a local timezone (such as `Atlantic/Reykjavik`) may have a zero offset, and will be considered to be UTC. In such cases, it may be useful to set `moment.defaultFormat` and `moment.defaultFormatUtc` to use the same formatting.

Changing the value of `moment.defaultFormat` will only affect formatting, and will not affect parsing. for example:

```
moment.defaultFormat = "DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm";
// parse with .toDate()
moment('20.07.2018 09:19').toDate() // Invalid date
// format the date string with the new defaultFormat then parse
moment('20.07.2018 09:19', moment.defaultFormat).toDate() // Fri Jul 20 2018 09:19:00 GMT+0300
```

### [Time from now](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/02-fromnow.md)

```
moment().fromNow();
moment().fromNow(Boolean);
```

A common way of displaying time is handled by `moment#fromNow`. This is sometimes called timeago or relative time.

```
moment([2007, 0, 29]).fromNow(); // 4 years ago
```

If you pass `true`, you can get the value without the suffix.

```
moment([2007, 0, 29]).fromNow();     // 4 years ago
moment([2007, 0, 29]).fromNow(true); // 4 years
```

The base strings are [customized by the current locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time/). Time is rounded to the nearest second.

The breakdown of which string is displayed for each length of time is outlined in the table below.

| Range | Key | Sample Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 44 seconds | s | a few seconds ago |
| *unset* | ss | 44 seconds ago |
| 45 to 89 seconds | m | a minute ago |
| 90 seconds to 44 minutes | mm | 2 minutes ago ... 44 minutes ago |
| 45 to 89 minutes | h | an hour ago |
| 90 minutes to 21 hours | hh | 2 hours ago ... 21 hours ago |
| 22 to 35 hours | d | a day ago |
| 36 hours to 25 days | dd | 2 days ago ... 25 days ago |
| 26 to 45 days | M | a month ago |
| 45 to 319 days | MM | 2 months ago ... 10 months ago |
| 320 to 547 days (1.5 years) | y | a year ago |
| 548 days+ | yy | 2 years ago ... 20 years ago |

**Note:** From version **2.10.3**, if the target moment object is invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

**Note:** The `ss` key was added in **2.18.0**. It is an optional threshold. It will never display UNLESS the user manually sets the ss threshold. Until the `ss` threshold is set, it defaults to the value of the `s` threshold minus 1 (so, invisible to the user).

### [Time from X](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/from/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/03-from.md)

```
moment().from(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().from(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, Boolean);
```

You may want to display a moment in relation to a time other than now. In that case, you can use `moment#from`.

```
var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.from(b) // "a day ago"
```

The first parameter is anything you can pass to `moment()` or an actual `Moment`.

```
var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.from(b);                     // "a day ago"
a.from([2007, 0, 29]);         // "a day ago"
a.from(new Date(2007, 0, 29)); // "a day ago"
a.from("2007-01-29");          // "a day ago"
```

Like `moment#fromNow`, passing `true` as the second parameter returns value without the suffix. This is useful wherever you need to have a human readable length of time.

```
var start = moment([2007, 0, 5]);
var end   = moment([2007, 0, 10]);
end.from(start);       // "in 5 days"
end.from(start, true); // "5 days"
```

From version **2.10.3**, if any of the endpoints are invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

### [Time to now](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/tonow/) 2.10.3+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/04-tonow.md)

```
moment().toNow();
moment().toNow(Boolean);
```

A common way of displaying time is handled by `moment#toNow`. This is sometimes called timeago or relative time.

This is similar to [`moment.fromNow`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/), but gives the opposite interval: `a.fromNow() = - a.toNow()`.

This is similar to [`moment.to`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/to/), but is special-cased for the current time. Use `moment.to`, if you want to control the two end points of the interval.

```
moment([2007, 0, 29]).toNow(); // in 4 years
```

If you pass `true`, you can get the value without the prefix.

```
moment([2007, 0, 29]).toNow();     // in 4 years
moment([2007, 0, 29]).toNow(true); // 4 years
```

The base strings are [customized by the current locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time/).

The breakdown of which string is displayed for each length of time is outlined in the table below.

| Range | Key | Sample Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 to 44 seconds | s | in seconds |
| 45 to 89 seconds | m | in a minute |
| 90 seconds to 44 minutes | mm | in 2 minutes ... in 44 minutes |
| 45 to 89 minutes | h | in an hour |
| 90 minutes to 21 hours | hh | in 2 hours ... in 21 hours |
| 22 to 35 hours | d | in a day |
| 36 hours to 25 days | dd | in 2 days ... in 25 days |
| 26 to 45 days | M | in a month |
| 45 to 319 days | MM | in 2 months ... in 10 months |
| 320 to 547 days (1.5 years) | y | in a year |
| 548 days+ | yy | in 2 years ... in 20 years |

From version **2.10.3**, if the target moment object is invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

### [Time to X](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/to/) 2.10.3+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/05-to.md)

```
moment().to(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().to(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, Boolean);
```

You may want to display a moment in relation to a time other than now. In that case, you can use `moment#to`.

```
var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.to(b) // "in a day"
```

The first parameter is anything you can pass to `moment()` or an actual `Moment`.

```
var a = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
a.to(b);                     // "in a day"
a.to([2007, 0, 29]);         // "in a day"
a.to(new Date(2007, 0, 29)); // "in a day"
a.to("2007-01-29");          // "in a day"
```

Like `moment#toNow`, passing `true` as the second parameter returns value without the suffix. This is useful wherever you need to have a human readable length of time.

```
var start = moment([2007, 0, 5]);
var end   = moment([2007, 0, 10]);
end.to(start);       // "5 days ago"
end.to(start, true); // "5 days"
```

From version **2.10.3**, if any of the endpoints are invalid the result is the localized Invalid date string.

### [Calendar Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/calendar-time/) 1.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/06-calendar-time.md)

```
moment().calendar();
moment().calendar(referenceDay);
moment().calendar(referenceDay, formats);  // from 2.10.5
moment().calendar(formats);  // from 2.25.0
```

Calendar time displays time relative to a given `referenceDay` (defaults to the start of today), but does so slightly differently than `moment#fromNow`.

`moment#calendar` will format a date with different strings depending on how close to `referenceDay`'s date (today by default) the date is.

| Last week | Last Monday at 2:30 AM |
| --- | --- |
| The day before | Yesterday at 2:30 AM |
| The same day | Today at 2:30 AM |
| The next day | Tomorrow at 2:30 AM |
| The next week | Sunday at 2:30 AM |
| Everything else | 7/10/2011 |

These strings are localized, and [can be customized](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/calendar/).

From **2.10.5** moment supports specifying calendar output formats per invocation:

```
moment().calendar(null, {
    sameDay: '[Today]',
    nextDay: '[Tomorrow]',
    nextWeek: 'dddd',
    lastDay: '[Yesterday]',
    lastWeek: '[Last] dddd',
    sameElse: 'DD/MM/YYYY'
});
```

`sameElse` is used as the format when the moment is more than a week away from the `referenceDay`

**Note:** From version **2.14.0** the formats argument to calendar can be a callback that is executed within the moment context with a single argument now:

```
moment().calendar(null, {
  sameDay: function (now) {
    if (this.isBefore(now)) {
      return '[Will Happen Today]';
    } else {
      return '[Happened Today]';
    }
    /* ... */
  }
});
```

**Note:** From version **2.25.0** you can only pass a formats argument, it could be an object of strings and functions:

```
moment().calendar({
    sameDay: '[Today]',
    nextDay: '[Tomorrow]',
    nextWeek: 'dddd',
    lastDay: '[Yesterday]',
    lastWeek: '[Last] dddd',
    sameElse: 'DD/MM/YYYY'
});

moment().calendar({
  sameDay: function (now) {
    if (this.isBefore(now)) {
      return '[Will Happen Today]';
    } else {
      return '[Happened Today]';
    }
    /* ... */
  }
});
```

### [Difference](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/difference/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/07-difference.md)

```
moment().diff(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().diff(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
moment().diff(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String, Boolean);
```

To get the difference in milliseconds, use `moment#diff` like you would use `moment#from`.

```
var a = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
a.diff(b) // 86400000
```

To get the difference in another unit of measurement, pass that measurement as the second argument.

```
var a = moment([2007, 0, 29]);
var b = moment([2007, 0, 28]);
a.diff(b, 'days') // 1
```

To get the duration of a difference between two moments, you can pass `diff` as an argument into `moment#duration`. See the docs on [moment#duration](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/diffing/) for more info.

The supported measurements are `years`, `months`, `weeks`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds`. For ease of development, the singular forms are supported as of **2.0.0**. Units of measurement other than milliseconds are available in version **1.1.1**.

By default, `moment#diff` will truncate the result to zero decimal places, returning an integer. If you want a floating point number, pass `true` as the third argument. Before **2.0.0**, `moment#diff` returned a number rounded to the nearest integer, not a truncated number.

```
var a = moment([2008, 9]);
var b = moment([2007, 0]);
a.diff(b, 'years');       // 1
a.diff(b, 'years', true); // 1.75
```

If the moment is earlier than the moment you are passing to `moment.fn.diff`, the return value will be negative.

```
var a = moment();
var b = moment().add(1, 'seconds');
a.diff(b) // -1000
b.diff(a) // 1000
```

An easy way to think of this is by replacing `.diff(` with a minus operator.

```
          // a < b
a.diff(b) // a - b < 0
b.diff(a) // b - a > 0
```

#### Month and year diffs

`moment#diff` has some special handling for month and year diffs. It is optimized to ensure that two months with the same date are always a whole number apart.

So Jan 15 to Feb 15 should be exactly 1 month.

Feb 28 to Mar 28 should be exactly 1 month.

Feb 28 2011 to Feb 28 2012 should be exactly 1 year.

[See more discussion on the month and year diffs here](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/571)

This change to month and year diffs was made in **2.0.0**. As of version **2.9.0** diff also support quarter unit.

### [Unix Timestamp (milliseconds)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/unix-timestamp-milliseconds/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/08-unix-timestamp-milliseconds.md)

```
moment().valueOf();
+moment();
```

`moment#valueOf` simply outputs the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch, just like `Date#valueOf`.

```
moment(1318874398806).valueOf(); // 1318874398806
+moment(1318874398806); // 1318874398806
```

To get a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since the epoch) from a `Moment`, use `moment#unix`.

[Note: ECMAScript calls this a "Time Value"](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-time-values-and-time-range)

### [Unix Timestamp (seconds)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/unix-timestamp/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/09-unix-timestamp.md)

`moment#unix` outputs a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch).

```
moment(1318874398806).unix(); // 1318874398
```

This value is floored to the nearest second, and does not include a milliseconds component.

### [Days in Month](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/days-in-month/) 1.5.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/10-days-in-month.md)

Get the number of days in the current month.

```
moment("2012-02", "YYYY-MM").daysInMonth() // 29
moment("2012-01", "YYYY-MM").daysInMonth() // 31
```

### [As Javascript Date](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-javascript-date/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/11-as-javascript-date.md)

To get a copy of the native Date object that Moment.js wraps, use `moment#toDate`.

This will return a copy of the `Date` that the moment uses, so any changes to that `Date` will not cause moment to change. If you want to change the moment `Date`, see `moment#manipulate` or `moment#set`.

`moment#native` has been replaced by `moment#toDate` and has been deprecated as of **1.6.0**.

### [As Array](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-array/) 1.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/12-as-array.md)

This returns an array that mirrors the parameters from `new Date()`.

```
moment().toArray(); // [2013, 1, 4, 14, 40, 16, 154];
```

### [As JSON](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-json/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/13-as-json.md)

When serializing an object to JSON, if there is a `Moment` object, it will be represented as an ISO8601 string, adjusted to UTC.

```
JSON.stringify({
    postDate : moment()
}); // '{"postDate":"2013-02-04T22:44:30.652Z"}'
```

If instead you would like an ISO8601 string that reflects the moment's `utcOffset()`, then you can modify the `toJSON` function like this:

```
moment.fn.toJSON = function() { return this.format(); }
```

This changes the behavior as follows:

```
JSON.stringify({
    postDate : moment()
}); // '{"postDate":"2013-02-04T14:44:30-08:00"}'
```

### [As ISO 8601 String](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-iso-string/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/14-as-iso-string.md)

```
moment().toISOString();
moment().toISOString(keepOffset); // from 2.20.0
```

Formats a string to the ISO8601 standard.

```
moment().toISOString() // 2013-02-04T22:44:30.652Z
```

Note that `.toISOString()` returns a timestamp in UTC, even if the moment in question is in local mode. This is done to provide consistency with the specification for native JavaScript Date `.toISOString()`, as outlined in [the ES2015 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date.prototype.toisostring). From version **2.20.0**, you may call `.toISOString(true)` to prevent UTC conversion.

From version **2.8.4** the native `Date.prototype.toISOString` is used if available, for performance reasons.

### [As Object](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-object/) 2.10.5+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/15-as-object.md)

This returns an object containing year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, seconds, milliseconds.

```
moment().toObject()  // {
                     //     years: 2015
                     //     months: 6
                     //     date: 26,
                     //     hours: 1,
                     //     minutes: 53,
                     //     seconds: 14,
                     //     milliseconds: 600
                     // }
```

### [As String](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/as-string/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/16-as-string.md)

Returns an english string in a similar format to JS Date's `.toString()`.

```
moment().toString() // "Sat Apr 30 2016 16:59:46 GMT-0500"
```

### [Inspect](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/inspect/) 2.16.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/04-displaying/17-inspect.md)

Returns a machine readable string, that can be evaluated to produce the same moment. Because of the name it's also used in node interactive shell to display objects.

```
moment().inspect() // 'moment("2016-11-09T22:23:27.861")'
moment.utc().inspect() // 'moment.utc("2016-11-10T06:24:10.638+00:00")'
moment.parseZone('2016-11-10T06:24:12.958+05:00').inspect() // 'moment.parseZone("2016-11-10T06:24:12.958+05:00")'
moment(new Date('nope')).inspect() // 'moment.invalid(/* Invalid Date */)'
moment('blah', 'YYYY').inspect() // 'moment.invalid(/* blah */)'
```

**Note:** This function is mostly intended for debugging, not all cases are handled precisely.

## [Query](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/)

### [Is Before](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-before/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/01-is-before.md)

```
moment().isBefore(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isBefore(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
```

Check if a moment is before another moment. The first argument will be parsed as a moment, if not already so.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2010-10-21'); // true
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using day will check for year, month and day.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2010-12-31', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isBefore('2011-01-01', 'year'); // true
```

Like `moment#isAfter` and `moment#isSame`, any of the units of time that are supported for `moment#startOf` are supported for `moment#isBefore`.

```
year month week isoWeek day hour minute second
```

If nothing is passed to `moment#isBefore`, it will default to the current time.

*NOTE*: `moment().isBefore()` has undefined behavior and should not be used! If the code runs fast the initial created moment would be the same as the one created in isBefore to perform the check, so the result would be `false`. But if the code runs slower it's possible that the moment created in isBefore is measurably after the one created in `moment()`, so the call would return `true`.

### [Is Same](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-same/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/02-is-same.md)

```
moment().isSame(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isSame(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
```

Check if a moment is the same as another moment. The first argument will be parsed as a moment, if not already so.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2010-10-20'); // true
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass it as the second parameter.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2009-12-31', 'year');  // false
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2010-01-01', 'year');  // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2010-12-31', 'year');  // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSame('2011-01-01', 'year');  // false
```

When including a second parameter, it will match all units equal or larger. Passing in `month` will check `month` and `year`. Passing in `day` will check `day`, `month`, and `year`.

```
moment('2010-01-01').isSame('2011-01-01', 'month'); // false, different year
moment('2010-01-01').isSame('2010-02-01', 'day');   // false, different month
```

Like `moment#isAfter` and `moment#isBefore`, any of the units of time that are supported for `moment#startOf` are supported for `moment#isSame`.

```
year month week isoWeek day hour minute second
```

If the two moments have different timezones, the timezone of the first moment will be used for the comparison.

```
// Note: Australia/Sydney is UTC+11:00 on these dates
moment.tz("2018-11-09T10:00:00", "Australia/Sydney").isSame(moment.tz("2018-11-08T12:00:00", "UTC"), "day"); // false
moment.tz("2018-11-08T12:00:00", "UTC").isSame(moment.tz("2018-11-09T10:00:00", "Australia/Sydney"), "day"); // true
```

*NOTE*: `moment().isSame()` has undefined behavior and should not be used! If the code runs fast the initial created moment would be the same as the one created in isSame to perform the check, so the result would be `true`. But if the code runs slower it's possible that the moment created in isSame is measurably after the one created in `moment()`, so the call would return `false`.

### [Is After](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-after/) 2.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/03-is-after.md)

```
moment().isAfter(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isAfter(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
```

Check if a moment is after another moment. The first argument will be parsed as a moment, if not already so.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2010-10-19'); // true
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using day will check for year, month and day.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2010-01-01', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isAfter('2009-12-31', 'year'); // true
```

Like `moment#isSame` and `moment#isBefore`, any of the units of time that are supported for `moment#startOf` are supported for `moment#isAfter`.

```
year month week isoWeek day hour minute second
```

If nothing is passed to `moment#isAfter`, it will default to the current time.

```
moment().isAfter(); // false
```

### [Is Same or Before](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-same-or-before/) 2.11.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/04-is-same-or-before.md)

```
moment().isSameOrBefore(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isSameOrBefore(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
```

Check if a moment is before or the same as another moment. The first argument will be parsed as a moment, if not already so.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrBefore('2010-10-21');  // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrBefore('2010-10-20');  // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrBefore('2010-10-19');  // false
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using day will check for year, month and day.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrBefore('2009-12-31', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrBefore('2010-12-31', 'year'); // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrBefore('2011-01-01', 'year'); // true
```

Like `moment#isAfter` and `moment#isSame`, any of the units of time that are supported for `moment#startOf` are supported for `moment#isSameOrBefore`:

```
year month week isoWeek day hour minute second
```

### [Is Same or After](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-same-or-after/) 2.11.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/05-is-same-or-after.md)

```
moment().isSameOrAfter(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array);
moment().isSameOrAfter(Moment|String|Number|Date|Array, String);
```

Check if a moment is after or the same as another moment. The first argument will be parsed as a moment, if not already so.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrAfter('2010-10-19'); // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrAfter('2010-10-20'); // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrAfter('2010-10-21'); // false
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the second parameter.

As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using day will check for year, month and day.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrAfter('2011-12-31', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrAfter('2010-01-01', 'year'); // true
moment('2010-10-20').isSameOrAfter('2009-12-31', 'year'); // true
```

Like `moment#isSame` and `moment#isBefore`, any of the units of time that are supported for `moment#startOf` are supported for `moment#isSameOrAfter`:

```
year month week isoWeek day hour minute second
```

### [Is Between](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-between/) 2.9.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/06-is-between.md)

```
//From 2.13.0 onward
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like);
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like, String);
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like, String, String);
// where moment-like is Moment|String|Number|Date|Array

//2.9.0 to 2.12.0
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like);
moment().isBetween(moment-like, moment-like, String);
// where moment-like is Moment|String|Number|Date|Array
```

Check if a moment is between two other moments, optionally looking at unit scale (minutes, hours, days, etc). The match is exclusive. The first two arguments will be parsed as moments, if not already so.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-10-19', '2010-10-25'); // true
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-10-19', undefined); // true, since moment(undefined) evaluates as moment()
```

Note that the order of the two arguments matter: the "smaller" date should be in the first argument.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-10-19', '2010-10-25'); // true
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-10-25', '2010-10-19'); // false
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass the units as the third parameter.

```
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2010-01-01', '2012-01-01', 'year'); // false
moment('2010-10-20').isBetween('2009-12-31', '2012-01-01', 'year'); // true
```

Like `moment#isSame`, `moment#isBefore`, `moment#isAfter` any of the units of time that are supported for `moment#startOf` are supported for `moment#isBetween`. Year, month, week, isoWeek, day, hour, minute, and second.

Version **2.13.0** introduces inclusivity. A `[` indicates inclusion of a value. A `(` indicates exclusion. If the inclusivity parameter is used, both indicators must be passed.

```
moment('2016-10-30').isBetween('2016-10-30', '2016-12-30', undefined, '()'); //false
moment('2016-10-30').isBetween('2016-10-30', '2016-12-30', undefined, '[)'); //true
moment('2016-10-30').isBetween('2016-01-01', '2016-10-30', undefined, '()'); //false
moment('2016-10-30').isBetween('2016-01-01', '2016-10-30', undefined, '(]'); //true
moment('2016-10-30').isBetween('2016-10-30', '2016-10-30', undefined, '[]'); //true
```

Note that in the event that the `from` and `to` parameters are the same, but the inclusivity parameters are different, false will preside.

```
moment('2016-10-30').isBetween('2016-10-30', '2016-10-30', undefined, '(]'); //false
```

If the inclusivity parameter is not specified, Moment will default to `()`.

### [Is Daylight Saving Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-daylight-saving-time/) 1.2.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/07-is-daylight-saving-time.md)

`moment#isDST` checks if the current moment is in daylight saving time.

**NOTE**: This function is a HACK. moment has no way of knowing if a given time is in actual DST or not. Some time changes in a zone are DST related, some are not, and without complete timezone information it can't know.

Moment currently checks the winter and summer time, and if the offset matches the summer offset (and summer off is different than winter off), then it reports DST. This works in vast majority of cases, but as mentioned above, is not "correct" and won't work for all cases. So don't come to us complaining.

Event moment-timezone (at moment of writing 0.5.37) doesn't support DST info (i.e is the clock officially in DST at a given moment or not), so for things to get better some new stuff (and tzdata bundling) has to happen in moment-timezone.

```
moment([2011, 2, 12]).isDST(); // false, March 12 2011 is not DST
moment([2011, 2, 14]).isDST(); // true, March 14 2011 is DST
// This example is for "en" locale: https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/2011.html
```

### [Is DST Shifted](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-dst-shifted/) From 2.3.0, Deprecated 2.14.0

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/08-is-dst-shifted.md)

```
moment('2013-03-10 2:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm').isDSTShifted()
```

**Note:** As of version **2.14.0** this function is **deprecated**. It doesn't give the right answer after modifying the moment object. For more information refer to [moment/3160](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/3160)

Another important piece of validation is to know if the date has been moved by a DST. For example, in most of the United States:

```
moment('2013-03-10 2:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm').format(); //=> '2013-03-10T01:30:00-05:00'
```

This is because daylight saving time shifts the time from 2:00 to 3:00, so 2:30 isn't a real time. The resulting time is browser-dependent, either adjusting the time forward or backwards. Use `moment#isDSTShifted` to test for this condition.

**Note:** before **2.3.0**, Moment objects in this condition always returned `false` for `moment#isValid`; they now return `true`.

### [Is Leap Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-leap-year/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/09-is-leap-year.md)

`moment#isLeapYear` returns `true` if that year is a leap year, and `false` if it is not.

```
moment([2000]).isLeapYear() // true
moment([2001]).isLeapYear() // false
moment([2100]).isLeapYear() // false
```

### [Is a Moment](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-a-moment/) 1.5.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/10-is-a-moment.md)

To check if a variable is a moment object, use `moment.isMoment()`.

```
moment.isMoment() // false
moment.isMoment(new Date()) // false
moment.isMoment(moment()) // true
```

From version **2.11.0**, you can also test for a moment object by `instanceof` operator:

```
moment() instanceof moment // true
```

### [Is a Date](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/is-a-date/) 2.9.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/05-query/11-is-a-date.md)

To check if a variable is a native js Date object, use `moment.isDate()`.

```
moment.isDate(); // false
moment.isDate(new Date()); // true
moment.isDate(moment()); // false
```

## [i18n](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/)

Moment.js has robust support for internationalization.

You can load multiple locales and easily switch between them.

In addition to assigning a global locale, you can assign a locale to a specific moment.

### [Changing locale globally](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/changing-locale/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/01-changing-locale.md)

```
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale(String);
moment.locale(String[]);
moment.locale(String, Object);

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang(String);
moment.lang(String[]);
moment.lang(String, Object);
```

By default, Moment.js comes with English (United States) locale strings. If you need other locales, you can load them into Moment.js for later use.

To load a locale, pass the key and the string values to `moment.locale`.

More details on each of the parts of the locale bundle can be found in the [customization](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/) section.

```
moment.locale('fr', {
    months : 'janvier_février_mars_avril_mai_juin_juillet_août_septembre_octobre_novembre_décembre'.split('_'),
    monthsShort : 'janv._févr._mars_avr._mai_juin_juil._août_sept._oct._nov._déc.'.split('_'),
    monthsParseExact : true,
    weekdays : 'dimanche_lundi_mardi_mercredi_jeudi_vendredi_samedi'.split('_'),
    weekdaysShort : 'dim._lun._mar._mer._jeu._ven._sam.'.split('_'),
    weekdaysMin : 'Di_Lu_Ma_Me_Je_Ve_Sa'.split('_'),
    weekdaysParseExact : true,
    longDateFormat : {
        LT : 'HH:mm',
        LTS : 'HH:mm:ss',
        L : 'DD/MM/YYYY',
        LL : 'D MMMM YYYY',
        LLL : 'D MMMM YYYY HH:mm',
        LLLL : 'dddd D MMMM YYYY HH:mm'
    },
    calendar : {
        sameDay : '[Aujourd’hui à] LT',
        nextDay : '[Demain à] LT',
        nextWeek : 'dddd [à] LT',
        lastDay : '[Hier à] LT',
        lastWeek : 'dddd [dernier à] LT',
        sameElse : 'L'
    },
    relativeTime : {
        future : 'dans %s',
        past : 'il y a %s',
        s : 'quelques secondes',
        m : 'une minute',
        mm : '%d minutes',
        h : 'une heure',
        hh : '%d heures',
        d : 'un jour',
        dd : '%d jours',
        M : 'un mois',
        MM : '%d mois',
        y : 'un an',
        yy : '%d ans'
    },
    dayOfMonthOrdinalParse : /\d{1,2}(er|e)/,
    ordinal : function (number) {
        return number + (number === 1 ? 'er' : 'e');
    },
    meridiemParse : /PD|MD/,
    isPM : function (input) {
        return input.charAt(0) === 'M';
    },
    // In case the meridiem units are not separated around 12, then implement
    // this function (look at locale/id.js for an example).
    // meridiemHour : function (hour, meridiem) {
    //     return /* 0-23 hour, given meridiem token and hour 1-12 */ ;
    // },
    meridiem : function (hours, minutes, isLower) {
        return hours < 12 ? 'PD' : 'MD';
    },
    week : {
        dow : 1, // Monday is the first day of the week.
        doy : 4  // Used to determine first week of the year.
    }
});
```

Details about `week.dow` and `week.doy` can be found in the [customization](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/dow-doy/) section.

Once you load a locale, it becomes the active locale. To change active locales, simply call `moment.locale` with the key of a loaded locale.

```
moment.locale('fr');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // il y a une heure
moment.locale('en');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // an hour ago
```

As of **2.21.0**, Moment will `console.warn` if the locale is unavailable.

As of **2.8.0**, changing the global locale doesn't affect existing instances.

```
moment.locale('fr');
var m = moment(1316116057189);
m.fromNow(); // il y a une heure

moment.locale('en');
m.fromNow(); // il y a une heure
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // an hour ago
```

`moment.locale` returns the locale used. This is useful because Moment won't change locales if it doesn't know the one you specify.

```
moment.locale('fr'); // 'fr'
moment.locale('tq'); // 'fr'
```

You may also specify a list of locales, and Moment will use the first one it has localizations for.

```
moment.locale(['tq', 'fr']); // 'fr'
```

Moment will also try locale specifier substrings from most-specific to least-specific until it finds a locale it knows. This is useful when supplying Moment with a locale string pulled from the user's environment, such as `window.navigator.language`.

```
moment.locale('en-nz'); // 'en'
```

Finally, Moment will search intelligently through an array of locales and their substrings.

```
moment.locale(['en-nz', 'en-au']); // 'en-au', not 'en'
```

The logic works as follows -- the next locale is picked and tried as-is. If that fails, the code normally tries to chop the last bit (normally the country designation) and try again. However, if the next array element has the same or longer prefix as the one to be tried, the iteration continues. So for example if the array has the sequence

```
"AA-BB", "AA-CC", "XX-YY"
```

then first "AA-BB" is tried, then a naive solution would try "AA", but this one instead checks to see that "AA-CC" is actually more concrete than "AA", so it tries "AA-CC" next, and only after it fails (if it fails) it tries "AA", because "XX-YY" does not have "AA" as prefix. So in the end the following locales are tried in this order (assuming all fail so the next one is tried):

```
"AA-BB", "AA-CC", "AA", "XX-YY", "XX"
```

### [Changing locales locally](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/instance-locale/) 1.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/02-instance-locale.md)

```
// From version 2.8.1 onward
moment().locale(String|String[]|Boolean);

// Deprecated version 2.8.1
moment().lang(String|String[]|Boolean);
```

A global locale configuration can be problematic when passing around moments that may need to be formatted into different locale.

```
moment.locale('en'); // default the locale to English
var localLocale = moment();

localLocale.locale('fr'); // set this instance to use French
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // dimanche 15 juillet 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Sunday, July 15 2012 11:01 AM

moment.locale('es'); // change the global locale to Spanish
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // dimanche 15 juillet 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Domingo 15 Julio 2012 11:01

localLocale.locale(['tq', 'fr']); // set this instance to the first localization found
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // dimanche 15 juillet 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Sunday, July 15 2012 11:01 AM

localLocale.locale(false); // reset the instance locale
localLocale.format('LLLL'); // Domingo 15 Julio 2012 11:01
moment().format('LLLL'); // Domingo 15 Julio 2012 11:01
```

If you call `moment#locale` with no parameters, you get back the locale configuration that would be used for that moment.

```
var fr = moment().locale('fr');
fr.localeData().months(moment([2012, 0])) // "janvier"
fr.locale('en');
fr.localeData().months(moment([2012, 0])) // "January"
```

If you need to access the locale data for a moment, this is the preferred way to do so.

As of **2.3.0**, you can also specify an array of locale identifiers. It works the same way it does in the [global locale configuration](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/changing-locale/).

### [Loading locales in NodeJS](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/loading-into-nodejs/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/03-loading-into-nodejs.md)

Loading locales in NodeJS is super easy. If there is a locale file in `moment/locale/` named after that key, import it first, then call `moment.locale` to load it.

```
var moment = require('moment');
//or
// import moment from 'moment';

// import locale file(s)
import 'moment/locale/fr';

moment.locale('fr');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // il y a 6 ans
```

To save the step of loading individual locales (i.e. just load them all), import the `moment/min/moment-with-locales` module instead.

```
import moment from 'moment/min/moment-with-locales';

moment.locale('de');
moment(1316116057189).fromNow(); // vor 6 Jahren
```

If you want your locale supported, create a pull request to the `develop` branch with the [required locale and unit test files](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/adding-locale/).

### [Loading locales in the browser](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/loading-into-browser/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/04-loading-into-browser.md)

```
// From 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale(String, Object);

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang(String, Object);
```

Loading locales in the browser just requires you to include the locale files. Be sure to specify the charset to prevent encoding issues.

```
<script src="moment.js"></script>
<script src="locale/fr.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<script src="locale/pt.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<script>
  moment.locale('fr');  // Set the default/global locale
  // ...
</script>
```

There are minified versions of all locales together:

```
<script src="moment.js"></script>
<script src="min/locales.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
```

To minimize HTTP requests, use our Grunt task to compile [Moment](https://github.com/moment/moment) with a custom list of locales:

```
grunt transpile:fr,it
```

```
<script src="min/moment-with-locales.custom.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
```

If you are using JSPM as plugin manager, you should add the locale in your lib.

```
import * as moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';
```

**Note:** Locale files are defined in [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) style, so they should work seamlessly in all environments.

### [Adding your locale to Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/adding-locale/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/05-adding-locale.md)

To add your locale to Moment.js, submit a pull request with both a locale file and a test file. You can find examples in `moment/src/locale/fr.js` and `moment/src/test/locale/fr.js`.

To run the tests in Node.js, do `npm install`, then `grunt`.

If all the tests pass, submit a pull request, and thank you for contributing!

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/06-getting-locale.md)

```
// From version 2.8.1 onward
moment.locale();

// Deprecated in version 2.8.1
moment.lang();
```

If you are changing locales frequently, you may want to know what locale is currently being used. This is as simple as calling `moment.locale` without any parameters.

```
moment.locale('en'); // set to english
moment.locale(); // returns 'en'
moment.locale('fr'); // set to french
moment.locale(); // returns 'fr'
```

As of version **2.12.0** it is possible to list all locales that have been loaded and are available to use:

```
moment.locales()
```

### [Listing the months and weekdays of the current Moment.js locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/listing-months-weekdays/) 2.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/07-listing-months-weekdays.md)

```
moment.months()
moment.monthsShort()
moment.weekdays()
moment.weekdaysShort()
moment.weekdaysMin()
```

It is sometimes useful to get the list of months or weekdays in a locale, for example when populating a dropdown menu.

```
moment.months();
```

Returns the list of months in the current locale.

```
[ 'January',
  'February',
  'March',
  'April',
  'May',
  'June',
  'July',
  'August',
  'September',
  'October',
  'November',
  'December' ]
```

Similarly, `moment.monthsShort` returns abbreviated month names, and `moment.weekdays`, `moment.weekdaysShort`, `moment.weekdaysMin` return lists of weekdays.

You can pass an integer into each of those functions to get a specific month or weekday.

```
moment.weekdays(3); // 'Wednesday'
```

As of **2.13.0** you can pass a bool as the first parameter of the weekday functions. If true, the weekdays will be returned in locale specific order. For instance, in the Arabic locale, Saturday is the first day of the week, thus:

```
moment.locale('ar');
moment.weekdays(true); // lists weekdays Saturday-Friday in Arabic
moment.weekdays(true, 2); //will result in Monday in Arabic
```

**Note:** Absent the locale specific parameter, weekdays always have Sunday as index 0, regardless of the local first day of the week.

Some locales make special considerations into account when formatting month names. For example, Dutch formats month abbreviations without a trailing period, but only if it's formatting the month between dashes. The `months` method supports passing a format in so that the months will be listed in the proper context.

```
moment.locale('nl');
moment.monthsShort(); // ['jan.', 'feb.', 'mrt.', ...]
moment.monthsShort('-MMM-'); // [ 'jan', 'feb', 'mrt', ...]
```

And finally, you can combine both the format option and the integer option.

```
moment.monthsShort('-MMM-', 3); // 'apr'
```

### [Accessing locale specific functionality](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/locale-data/) 2.8.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/08-locale-data.md)

```
localeData = moment.localeData()
localeData.months(Moment)
localeData.months()
localeData.monthsShort(Moment)
localeData.monthsShort()
localeData.monthsParse(String)
localeData.weekdays(Moment)
localeData.weekdays()
localeData.weekdays(Boolean)      ## Added 2.24.0, sorts weekdays by locale
localeData.weekdaysShort(Moment)
localeData.weekdaysShort()
localeData.weekdaysShort(Boolean) ## Added 2.24.0, sorts weekdays by locale
localeData.weekdaysMin(Moment)
localeData.weekdaysMin()
localeData.weekdaysMin(Boolean)   ## Added 2.24.0, sorts weekdays by locale
localeData.weekdaysParse(String)
localeData.longDateFormat(String)
localeData.isPM(String)
localeData.meridiem(Number, Number, Boolean)
localeData.calendar(String, Moment)
localeData.relativeTime(Number, Boolean, String, Boolean)
localeData.pastFuture(Number, String)
localeData.ordinal(Number)
localeData.preparse(String)
localeData.postformat(String)
localeData.week(Moment)
localeData.invalidDate()
localeData.firstDayOfWeek()
localeData.firstDayOfYear()
```

You can access the properties of the currently loaded locale through the `moment.localeData(key)` function. It returns the current locale or a locale with the given key:

```
// get current locale
var currentLocaleData = moment.localeData();
var frLocaleData = moment.localeData('fr');
```

The returned object has the following methods:

```
localeData.months(aMoment);  // full month name of aMoment
localeData.monthsShort(aMoment);  // short month name of aMoment
localeData.monthsParse(longOrShortMonthString);  // returns month id (0 to 11) of input
localeData.weekdays(aMoment);  // full weekday name of aMoment
localeData.weekdaysShort(aMoment);  // short weekday name of aMoment
localeData.weekdaysMin(aMoment);  // min weekday name of aMoment
localeData.weekdaysParse(minShortOrLongWeekdayString);  // returns weekday id (0 to 6) of input
localeData.longDateFormat(dateFormat);  // returns the full format of abbreviated date-time formats LT, L, LL and so on
localeData.isPM(amPmString);  // returns true iff amPmString represents PM
localeData.meridiem(hours, minutes, isLower);  // returns am/pm string for particular time-of-day in upper/lower case
localeData.calendar(key, aMoment);  // returns a format that would be used for calendar representation. Key is one of 'sameDay', 'nextDay', 'lastDay', 'nextWeek', 'prevWeek', 'sameElse'
localeData.relativeTime(number, withoutSuffix, key, isFuture);  // returns relative time string, key is on of 's', 'm', 'mm', 'h', 'hh', 'd', 'dd', 'M', 'MM', 'y', 'yy'. Single letter when number is 1.
localeData.pastFuture(diff, relTime);  // convert relTime string to past or future string depending on diff
localeData.ordinal(number);  // convert number to ordinal string 1 -> 1st
localeData.preparse(str);  // called before parsing on every input string
localeData.postformat(str);  // called after formatting on every string
localeData.week(aMoment);  // returns week-of-year of aMoment
localeData.invalidDate();  // returns a translation of 'Invalid date'
localeData.firstDayOfWeek();  // 0-6 (Sunday to Saturday)
localeData.firstDayOfYear();  // 0-15 Used to determine first week of the year.
```

Details about `firstDayOfYear` can be found in the [customization](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/dow-doy/) section.

### [Pseudo Locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/pseudo-locale/) 2.13.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/06-i18n/09-pseudo-locale.md)

```
moment.locale('x-pseudo')
```

As of version **2.13.0** moment optionally includes a pseudo locale. This locale will populate the dates with very obviously changed data. Pseudo locales can be useful when testing, as they make obvious what data has and has not been localized. Just include the pseudo-locale, and set moment's locale to x-pseudo. Text from Moment will be very easy to spot.

```
moment.locale('x-pseudo');
moment().format('LLL'); //14 F~ébrú~árý 2010 15:25
moment().fromNow(); //'á ~féw ~sécó~ñds á~gó'
moment().calendar(); //'T~ódá~ý át 02:00'
```

## [Customize](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/)

Moment.js is very easy to customize. In general, you should create a locale setting with your customizations.

```
moment.locale('en-my-settings', {
    // customizations.
});
```

You can remove a previously defined locale by passing `null` as the second argument. The deleted locale will no longer be available for use.

```
moment.locale('fr'); // 'fr'
moment.locale('en'); // 'en'
moment.locale('fr', null);
moment.locale('fr'); // 'en'
```

As of **2.12.0** it is possible to create a locale that inherits from a parent locale.

```
moment.defineLocale('en-foo', {
  parentLocale: 'en',
  /* */
});
```

Properties that are not specified in the locale will be inherited from the parent locale.

As of **2.16.0** it is possible to define a locale with a parent that hasn't itself been defined or loaded.

```
moment.defineLocale('fakeLocale', {parentLocale:'xyz'})
```

As of **2.21.0** when attempting to create a moment with the newly defined locale, moment will attempt to lazy load the parent if it exists. Failing that it will default the parent to the global locale.

As of **2.12.0** it is also possible to update a locale's properties.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
  /**/
});
```

Any properties specified will be updated, while others will remain the same. This function does not affect moments that already exist. Note that calling `updateLocale` also changes the current global locale, to the locale that is updated; see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/5410) for more information.

To revert an update use:

```
moment.updateLocale('en', null);
```

**2.12.0** deprecated using `moment.locale()` to change an existing locale. Use `moment.updateLocale()` instead.

### [Month Names](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/month-names/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/01-month-names.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    months : String[]
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    months : Function
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    months : {
        format : String[],
        standalone : String[]
    }
});
// From 2.11.0
moment.locale('en', {
    months : {
        format : String[],
        standalone : String[]
    }
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    months : String[]
});
moment.locale('en', {
    months : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    months : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    months : Function
});
```

`Locale#months` should be an array of the month names.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    months : [
        "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
        "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
    ]
});
```

If you need more processing to calculate the name of the month, (for example, if there is different grammar for different formats), `Locale#months` can be a function with the following signature. It should always return a month name.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    months : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        // momentToFormat is the moment currently being formatted
        // format is the formatting string
        if (/^MMMM/.test(format)) { // if the format starts with 'MMMM'
            return nominative[momentToFormat.month()];
        } else {
            return subjective[momentToFormat.month()];
        }
    }
});
```

From version **2.11.0** months can also be an object, specifying `standalone` and `format` forms (nominative and accusative). The regular expression that is run on the format to check whether to use the `format` form is `/D[oD]?(\[[^\[\]]*\]|\s+)+MMMM?/`. From version **2.14.0** a different one can be specified with the `isFormat` key.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    months : {
         format: 'sausio_vasario_kovo_balandžio_gegužės_birželio_liepos_rugpjūčio_rugsėjo_spalio_lapkričio_gruodžio'.split('_'),
         standalone: 'sausis_vasaris_kovas_balandis_gegužė_birželis_liepa_rugpjūtis_rugsėjis_spalis_lapkritis_gruodis'.split('_'),
         isFormat: /D[oD]?(\[[^\[\]]*\]|\s+)+MMMM?|MMMM?(\[[^\[\]]*\]|\s+)+D[oD]?/  // from 2.14.0
    }
});
```

### [Month Abbreviations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/month-abbreviations/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/02-month-abbreviations.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    monthsShort : String[]
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    monthsShort : Function
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    monthsShort : {
        format: String[],
        standalone : String[]
    }
});
// From 2.11.0
moment.locale('en', {
    monthsShort : {
        format: String[],
        standalone : String[]
    }
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    monthsShort : String[]
});
moment.locale('en', {
    monthsShort : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    monthsShort : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    monthsShort : Function
});
```

`Locale#monthsShort` should be an array of the month abbreviations.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    monthsShort : [
        "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
        "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
    ]
});
```

Like `Locale#months`, `Locale#monthsShort` can be a callback function as well.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    monthsShort : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        if (/^MMMM/.test(format)) {
            return nominative[momentToFormat.month()];
        } else {
            return subjective[momentToFormat.month()];
        }
    }
});
```

**Note:** From version **2.11.0**, like `Locale#months`, `Locale#monthsShort` can be an object with `standalone` and `format` cases.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    monthsShort : {
        format: 'янв_фев_мар_апр_мая_июня_июля_авг_сен_окт_ноя_дек'.split('_'),
        standalone: 'янв_фев_март_апр_май_июнь_июль_авг_сен_окт_ноя_дек'.split('_')
    }
});
```

### [Weekday Names](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/weekday-names/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/03-weekday-names.md)

```
// From version 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdays : String[]
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdays : Function
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdays : {
        standalone : String[],
        format : String[],
        isFormat : RegExp
    }
});
// From version 2.11.0
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdays : {
        standalone : String[],
        format : String[],
        isFormat : Boolean
    }
});
// From version 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdays : String[]
});
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdays : Function
});

// Deprecated version 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdays : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdays : Function
});
```

`Locale#weekdays` should be an array of the weekdays names.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdays : [
        "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"
    ]
});
```

`Locale#weekdays` can be a callback function as well.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdays : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        return weekdays[momentToFormat.day()];
    }
});
```

**Note:** From version **2.11.0** format/standalone cases can be passed as well. `isFormat` will be used against the full format string to determine which form to use.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdays : {
        standalone: 'Воскресенье_Понедельник_Вторник_Среда_Четверг_Пятница_Суббота'.split('_'),
        format: 'Воскресенье_Понедельник_Вторник_Среду_Четверг_Пятницу_Субботу'.split('_'),
        isFormat: /\[ ?[Вв] ?(?:прошлую|следующую|эту)? ?\] ?dddd/
    }
});
```

### [Weekday Abbreviations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/weekday-abbreviations/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/04-weekday-abbreviations.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : String[]
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : Function
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : String[]
});
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdaysShort : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdaysShort : Function
});
```

`Locale#weekdaysShort` should be an array of the weekdays abbreviations.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]
});
```

`Locale#weekdaysShort` can be a callback function as well.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysShort : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        return weekdaysShort[momentToFormat.day()];
    }
});
```

### [Minimal Weekday Abbreviations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/weekday-min/) 1.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/05-weekday-min.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : String[]
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : Function
});

// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : String[]
});
moment.locale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdaysMin : String[]
});
moment.lang('en', {
    weekdaysMin : Function
});
```

`Locale#weekdaysMin` should be an array of two letter weekday abbreviations. The purpose of these is for things like calendar pickers, thus they should be as small as possible.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : ["Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa"]
});
```

`Locale#weekdaysMin` can be a callback function as well.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : function (momentToFormat, format) {
        return weekdaysMin[momentToFormat.day()];
    }
});
```

### [Long Date Formats](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/long-date-formats/) 1.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/06-long-date-formats.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : String[]
});
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    weekdaysMin : Function
});

// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    longDateFormat : Object
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    longDateFormat : Object
});
```

`Locale#longDateFormat` should be an object containing a key/value pair for each long date format `L LL LLL LLLL LT LTS`. `LT` should be the time format, and is also used for `moment#calendar`.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    longDateFormat : {
        LT: "h:mm A",
        LTS: "h:mm:ss A",
        L: "MM/DD/YYYY",
        l: "M/D/YYYY",
        LL: "MMMM Do YYYY",
        ll: "MMM D YYYY",
        LLL: "MMMM Do YYYY LT",
        lll: "MMM D YYYY LT",
        LLLL: "dddd, MMMM Do YYYY LT",
        llll: "ddd, MMM D YYYY LT"
    }
});
```

You can eliminate the lowercase `l` tokens and they will be created automatically by replacing long tokens with the short token variants.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    longDateFormat : {
        LT: "h:mm A",
        LTS: "h:mm:ss A",
        L: "MM/DD/YYYY",
        LL: "MMMM Do YYYY",
        LLL: "MMMM Do YYYY LT",
        LLLL: "dddd, MMMM Do YYYY LT"
    }
});
```

### [Relative Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/07-relative-time.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    relativeTime : Object
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    relativeTime : Object
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    relativeTime : Object
});
```

`Locale#relativeTime` should be an object of the replacement strings for `moment#from`.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    relativeTime : {
        future: "in %s",
        past:   "%s ago",
        s  : 'a few seconds',
        ss : '%d seconds',
        m:  "a minute",
        mm: "%d minutes",
        h:  "an hour",
        hh: "%d hours",
        d:  "a day",
        dd: "%d days",
        w:  "a week",
        ww: "%d weeks",
        M:  "a month",
        MM: "%d months",
        y:  "a year",
        yy: "%d years"
    }
});
```

`Locale#relativeTime.future` refers to the prefix/suffix for future dates, and `Locale#relativeTime.past` refers to the prefix/suffix for past dates. For all others, a single character refers to the singular, and a double character refers to the plural.

If a locale requires additional processing for a token, it can set the token as a function with the following signature. The function should return a string.

```
function (number, withoutSuffix, key, isFuture) {
    return string;
}
```

The `key` argument refers to the replacement key in the `Locale#relativeTime` object. (eg. `s m mm h`, etc.)

The `number` argument refers to the number of units for that key. For `m`, the number is the number of minutes, etc.

The `withoutSuffix` argument will be true if the token will be displayed without a suffix, and false if it will be displayed with a suffix. (The reason for the inverted logic is because the default behavior is to display with the suffix.)

The `isFuture` argument will be true if it is going to use the future suffix/prefix and false if it is going to use the past prefix/suffix.

**Note**: Handling for `w` and `ww` was added in **2.25.0**.

### [AM/PM](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/am-pm/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/08-am-pm.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    meridiem : Function
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    meridiem : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    meridiem : Function
});
```

If your locale uses 'am/pm', `Locale#meridiem` can be omitted, as those values are the defaults.

If your locale needs any different computation for am/pm, `Locale#meridiem` should be a callback function that returns the correct string based on hour, minute, and upper/lowercase.

```
moment.updateLocale('zh-cn', {
    meridiem : function (hour, minute, isLowercase) {
        if (hour < 9) {
            return "早上";
        } else if (hour < 11 && minute < 30) {
            return "上午";
        } else if (hour < 13 && minute < 30) {
            return "中午";
        } else if (hour < 18) {
            return "下午";
        } else {
            return "晚上";
        }
    }
});
```

### [AM/PM Parsing](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/am-pm-parsing/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/09-am-pm-parsing.md)

moment.lang('en', {
    meridiemParse : RegExp
    isPM : Function
});
```

`Locale#isPM` should return true if the input string is past 12 noon. This is used in parsing the `a A` tokens.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    isPM : function (input) {
        return ((input + '').toLowerCase()[0] === 'p');
    }
});
```

To configure what strings should be parsed as input, set the `meridiemParse` property.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    meridiemParse : /[ap]\.?m?\.?/i
});
```

### [Calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/calendar/) 1.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/10-calendar.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    calendar : Object
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    calendar : Object
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    calendar : Object
});
```

`Locale#calendar` should have the following formatting strings.

```
moment.locale('en', {
    calendar : {
        lastDay : '[Yesterday at] LT',
        sameDay : '[Today at] LT',
        nextDay : '[Tomorrow at] LT',
        lastWeek : '[last] dddd [at] LT',
        nextWeek : 'dddd [at] LT',
        sameElse : 'L'
    }
});
```

Each of the `Locale#calendar` keys can also be a callback function with the scope of the current moment and first argument a moment that depicts now. It should return a formatting string.

```
function callback (now) {
    return '[hoy a la' + ((this.hours() !== 1) ? 's' : '') + '] LT';
}
```

### [Calendar Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/calendar-format/) 2.14.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/11-calendar-format.md)

```
moment.calendarFormat = Function
```

This lets you modify the tokens used by [calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/calendar/).

```
moment.calendarFormat = function (myMoment, now) {
    var diff = myMoment.diff(now, 'days', true);
    var nextMonth = now.clone().add(1, 'month');

    var retVal =  diff < -6 ? 'sameElse' :
        diff < -1 ? 'lastWeek' :
        diff < 0 ? 'lastDay' :
        diff < 1 ? 'sameDay' :
        diff < 2 ? 'nextDay' :
        diff < 7 ? 'nextWeek' :
        // introduce thisMonth and nextMonth
        (myMoment.month() === now.month() && myMoment.year() === now.year()) ? 'thisMonth' :
        (nextMonth.month() === myMoment.month() && nextMonth.year() === myMoment.year()) ? 'nextMonth' : 'sameElse';
    return retVal;
};
```

### [Ordinal](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/ordinal/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/12-ordinal.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    ordinal : Function
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    ordinal : Function
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    ordinal : Function
});
```

`Locale#ordinal` should be a function that returns the ordinal for a given number.

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    ordinal : function (number, token) {
        var b = number % 10;
        var output = (~~ (number % 100 / 10) === 1) ? 'th' :
            (b === 1) ? 'st' :
            (b === 2) ? 'nd' :
            (b === 3) ? 'rd' : 'th';
        return number + output;
    }
});
```

As of **2.0.0**, the ordinal function should return both the number and the ordinal. Previously, only the ordinal was returned.

As of **2.1.0**, the token parameter was added. It is a string of the token that is being ordinalized, for example: `M` or `d`.

For more information on ordinal numbers, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number_%28linguistics%29).

### [Relative Time Thresholds](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time-threshold/) 2.7.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/13-relative-time-threshold.md)

```
moment.relativeTimeThreshold(unit);  // getter
moment.relativeTimeThreshold(unit, limit);  // setter
```

`duration.humanize` has thresholds which define when a unit is considered a minute, an hour and so on. For example, by default more than 45 seconds is considered a minute, more than 22 hours is considered a day and so on. To change those cutoffs use `moment.relativeTimeThreshold(unit, limit)` where unit is one of `ss`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w`, `M`.

| unit | meaning | usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ss | a few seconds | least number of seconds to be counted in seconds, minus 1. Must be set after setting the \`s\` unit or without setting the \`s\` unit. |
| s | seconds | least number of seconds to be considered a minute. |
| m | minutes | least number of minutes to be considered an hour. |
| h | hours | least number of hours to be considered a day. |
| d | days | least number of days to be considered a week. |
| w | weeks | least number of weeks to be considered a month. Not used by default. |
| M | months | least number of months to be considered a year. |

```
  // Retrieve existing thresholds
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('ss'); // 44
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('s');  // 45
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('m');  // 45
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('h');  // 22
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('d');  // 26
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('w');  // null (disabled)
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('M');  // 11

  // Set new thresholds
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('s', 40);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('ss', 3);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('m', 40);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('h', 20);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('d', 25);
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('w', 4);  // enables weeks
  moment.relativeTimeThreshold('M', 10);
```

**Note:** Week unit was added in **2.25.0**. By default it is not used (set to null), but you can set it to non-null value, and also (optionally) set `d` lower, so it transitions from days to weeks earlier.

**Note:** Retrieving thresholds was added in **2.8.1**.

**Note:** Retrieving and setting `ss` threshold was added in **2.18.0**.

### [Relative Time Rounding](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time-rounding/) 2.14.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/14-relative-time-rounding.md)

```
moment.relativeTimeRounding();  // getter
moment.relativeTimeRounding(fn);  // setter
```

`duration.humanize` rounds a possibly double value before supplying it to the relativeTime format string specified in the locale. To control the rounding you can use `moment.relativeTimeRounding`.

```
var roundingDefault = moment.relativeTimeRounding();

// Round relative time evaluation down
moment.relativeTimeRounding(Math.floor);

moment.relativeTimeThreshold('s', 60);
moment.relativeTimeThreshold('m', 60);
moment.relativeTimeThreshold('h', 24);
moment.relativeTimeThreshold('d', 7);
moment.relativeTimeThreshold('w', 4);
moment.relativeTimeThreshold('M', 12);

var a = moment();
a.subtract({hours: 23, minutes: 59, seconds: 59});
a.toNow();  // == 'in 23 hours'  'Round down towards the nearest hour'

// back to default
moment.relativeTimeRounding(roundingDefault);
```

You can even choose to do no rounding at all:

```
var retainValue = function (value) {
    return value;
};
moment.relativeTimeRounding(retainValue);

var a = moment();
a.subtract({hours: 39});
a.toNow(); // == 'in 1.625 days', 'Round down towards the nearest year'
```

### [Changing Time Source](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/now/) 2.11.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/15-now.md)

```
moment.now = function () { return +new Date(); }
```

If you want to change the time that Moment sees, you can specify a method that returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

The default is:

```
moment.now = function () {
    return +new Date();
}
```

This will be used when calling `moment()`, and the current date used when tokens are omitted from `format()`. In general, any method that needs the current time uses this under the hood.

### [First Day of Week and First Week of Year](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/dow-doy/) 1.0.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/16-dow-doy.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    week : {
        dow : Int,
        doy : Int
     }
});
// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    week : {
        dow : Int,
        doy : Int
    }
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    week : {
        dow : Int,
        doy : Int
    }
});
```

`Locale#week.dow` should be an integer representing the first day of the week, 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, ..., 6 is Saturday.

`Locale#week.doy` should be an integer. `doy` is used together with `dow` to determine the first week of the year. `doy` is calculated as `7 + dow - janX`, where `janX` is the first day of January that must belong to the first week of the year.

```
// ISO-8601, Europe
moment.updateLocale("en", { week: {
  dow: 1, // First day of week is Monday
  doy: 4  // First week of year must contain 4 January (7 + 1 - 4)
}});

// US, Canada
moment.updateLocale("en", { week: {
  dow: 0, // First day of week is Sunday
  doy: 6  // First week of year must contain 1 January (7 + 0 - 1)
}});

// Many Arab countries
moment.updateLocale("en", { week: {
  dow: 6, // First day of week is Saturday
  doy: 12 // First week of year must contain 1 January (7 + 6 - 1)
}});

// Also common
moment.updateLocale("en", { week: {
  dow: 1, // First day of week is Monday
  doy: 7  // First week of year must contain 1 January (7 + 1 - 1)
}});
```

### [Eras](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/eras/) 2.25.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/17-eras.md)

```
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    eras: [{
        since:  '0001-01-01',
        until:  +Infinity,
        offset: 1,
        name:   'Anno Domini',
        narrow: 'AD',
        abbr:   'AD'
    }, {
        until:   -Infinity,
        since:  '0000-12-31',
        offset: 1,
        name:   'Before Christ',
        narrow: 'BC',
        abbr:   'BC'
    }],
});
```

Specify Eras for a particular locale. An era is a time interval with name and year numbering. Absolute year number (like 2020) can also be specified as 2020 AD: the 2020th year of the era AD. Similarly the absolute year number -0500 can be described as 501 BC, the 501st year from the BC era.

```
eras: [{
    since:  '0001-01-01', // the start of the era
    until:  +Infinity,    // the end of the era, can be +/-Infinity
    offset: 1,            // added to year to (mostly) avoid 0 era years
    name:   'Anno Domini',// full name of era
    narrow: 'AD',         // narrow name of era
    abbr:   'AD'          // abbreviated name of era
}]
```

`since` and `until` govern the direction of the era. As in the case of `BC` it grows toward `-Infinity`, thus `since` > `until`. For eras that increment toward +Infinity `since` < `until`.

Parsing/formatting of eras is accomplished with `yo`, `y*` and `N*` tokens.

**Note**: The era-related APIs are subject to change.

### [Invalid Date](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/invalid-date/) 2.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/07-customization/18-invalid-date.md)

```
// From 2.12.0 onward
moment.updateLocale('en', {
    invalidDate : String
});

// From 2.8.1 to 2.11.2
moment.locale('en', {
    invalidDate : String
});

// Deprecated in 2.8.1
moment.lang('en', {
    invalidDate : String
});
```

`Locale#invalidDate` should be a string.

```
moment.updateLocale("es", {
  invalidDate: "Fecha invalida"
});
```

## [Durations](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/)

Moment.js also has duration objects. Where a moment is defined as a single point in time, a duration is defined as a length of time.

Durations do not have a defined beginning and end date. They are contextless.

A duration is conceptually more similar to '2 hours' than to 'between 2 and 4 pm today'. As such, they are not a good solution to converting between units that depend on context.

For example, a year can be defined as 366 days, 365 days, 365.25 days, 12 months, or 52 weeks. Trying to convert years to days makes no sense without context. It is much better to use `moment#diff` for calculating days or years between two moments than to use `Durations`.

As [discussed here](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/4815), the duration format for Moment.js differs very slightly from the specifications for ISO 8601 nominal duration and RFC 5545 duration.

### [Creating](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/creating/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/01-creating.md)

```
moment.duration(Number, String);
moment.duration(Number);
moment.duration(Object);
moment.duration(String);
moment.duration(String, String); // 2.25.0
```

To create a duration, call `moment.duration()` with the length of time in milliseconds.

```
moment.duration(100); // 100 milliseconds
```

If you want to create a moment with a unit of measurement other than milliseconds, you can pass the unit of measurement as well.

```
moment.duration(2, 'seconds');
moment.duration(2, 'minutes');
moment.duration(2, 'hours');
moment.duration(2, 'days');
moment.duration(2, 'weeks');
moment.duration(2, 'months');
moment.duration(2, 'years');
moment.duration('2', 'years'); // from 2.25.0
```

The same shorthand for `moment#add` and `moment#subtract` works here as well.

| Key | Shorthand |
| --- | --- |
| years | y |
| months | M |
| weeks | w |
| days | d |
| hours | h |
| minutes | m |
| seconds | s |
| milliseconds | ms |

Much like `moment#add`, you can pass an object of values if you need multiple different units of measurement.

```
moment.duration({
    seconds: 2,
    minutes: 2,
    hours: 2,
    days: 2,
    weeks: 2,
    months: '2',
    years: '2'
});
```

As of **2.1.0**, moment supports parsing ASP.NET style time spans. The following formats are supported.

The format is an hour, minute, second string separated by colons like `23:59:59`. The number of days can be prefixed with a dot separator like so `7.23:59:59`. Partial seconds are supported as well `23:59:59.999`.

```
moment.duration('23:59:59');
moment.duration('23:59:59.999');
moment.duration('7.23:59:59.999');
moment.duration('23:59'); // added in 2.3.0
```

As of **2.3.0**, moment also supports parsing [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals) durations.

```
moment.duration('P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S');
moment.duration('P1M');
```

As of **2.11.0**, duration format strings with a space between days and rest is supported.

```
moment.duration('7 23:59:59.999');
```

As of **2.13.0**, mixed negative and positive signs are supported when parsing durations.

```
moment.duration('PT-6H3M')
```

As of **2.18.0**, invalid durations are supported, similarly to invalid moments. To create an invalid duration you can pass `NaN` for a value of a unit.

In upcoming releases expect invalid durations to cover more cases (like null values for units).

```
moment.duration(NaN);
moment.duration(NaN, 'days');
moment.duration.invalid();
```

### [Clone](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/clone/) 2.19.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/02-clone.md)

```
moment.duration().clone();
```

Create a clone of a duration. Durations are mutable, just like moment objects, so this lets you get a snapshot, at some point in time.

```
var d1 = moment.duration();
var d2 = d1.clone();
d1.add(1, 'second');
d1.asMilliseconds() !== d2.asMilliseconds();
```

### [Humanize](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/humanize/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/03-humanize.md)

```
moment.duration().humanize();
moment.duration().humanize(withSuffix);
moment.duration().humanize(withSuffix, thresholds); // from 2.25.0
moment.duration().humanize(thresholds);             // from 2.25.0
```

Sometimes, you want all the goodness of `moment#from` but you don't want to have to create two moments, you just want to display a length of time.

Enter `moment.duration().humanize()`.

```
moment.duration(1, "minutes").humanize(); // a minute
moment.duration(2, "minutes").humanize(); // 2 minutes
moment.duration(24, "hours").humanize();  // a day
```

By default, the return string is describing a duration `a month` (suffix-less). If you want an oriented duration `in a month`, `a month ago` (with suffix), pass in true as seen below.

```
moment.duration(1, "minutes").humanize(true); // in a minute
```

For suffixes before now, pass in a negative number.

```
moment.duration(-1, "minutes").humanize(true); // a minute ago
```

Invalid durations are humanized to the localized version of `Invalid Date`.

```
moment.duration.invalid().humanize(); // Invalid Date
```

Humanize output can be configured with relative time thresholds. To specify thresholds for a particular invocation of humanize, pass them as a sole argument or after suffix arg:

```
moment.duration(-1, 'week').humanize(true, {d: 7, w: 4}); // a week ago
moment.duration(-1, 'week').humanize({d: 7, w: 4}); // a week
```

**Note**: Passing thresholds in humanize was added in **2.25.0**.

### [Milliseconds](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/milliseconds/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/04-milliseconds.md)

```
moment.duration().milliseconds();
moment.duration().asMilliseconds();
```

To get the number of milliseconds in a duration, use `moment.duration().milliseconds()`.

It will return a number between 0 and 999.

```
moment.duration(500).milliseconds(); // 500
moment.duration(1500).milliseconds(); // 500
moment.duration(15000).milliseconds(); // 0
```

If you want the length of the duration in milliseconds, use `moment.duration().asMilliseconds()` instead.

```
moment.duration(500).asMilliseconds(); // 500
moment.duration(1500).asMilliseconds(); // 1500
moment.duration(15000).asMilliseconds(); // 15000
```

### [Seconds](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/seconds/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/05-seconds.md)

```
moment.duration().seconds();
moment.duration().asSeconds();
```

To get the number of seconds in a duration, use `moment.duration().seconds()`.

It will return a number between 0 and 59.

```
moment.duration(500).seconds(); // 0
moment.duration(1500).seconds(); // 1
moment.duration(15000).seconds(); // 15
```

If you want the length of the duration in seconds, use `moment.duration().asSeconds()` instead.

```
moment.duration(500).asSeconds(); // 0.5
moment.duration(1500).asSeconds(); // 1.5
moment.duration(15000).asSeconds(); // 15
```

### [Minutes](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/minutes/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/06-minutes.md)

```
moment.duration().minutes();
moment.duration().asMinutes();
```

As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().minutes()` gets the minutes (0 - 59).

`moment.duration().asMinutes()` gets the length of the duration in minutes.

### [Hours](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/hours/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/07-hours.md)

```
moment.duration().hours();
moment.duration().asHours();
```

As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().hours()` gets the hours (0 - 23).

`moment.duration().asHours()` gets the length of the duration in hours.

### [Days](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/days/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/08-days.md)

```
moment.duration().days();
moment.duration().asDays();
```

As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().days()` gets the days (0 - 30).

`moment.duration().asDays()` gets the length of the duration in days.

### [Weeks](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/weeks/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/09-weeks.md)

```
moment.duration().weeks();
moment.duration().asWeeks();
```

As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().weeks()` gets the weeks (0 - 4).

`moment.duration().asWeeks()` gets the length of the duration in weeks.

Pay attention that unlike the other getters for duration, weeks are counted as a subset of the days, and are not taken off the days count.

**Note:** The length of a duration in weeks is defined as 7 days.

### [Months](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/months/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/10-months.md)

```
moment.duration().months();
moment.duration().asMonths();
```

As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().months()` gets the months (0 - 11).

`moment.duration().asMonths()` gets the length of the duration in months.

### [Years](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/years/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/11-years.md)

```
moment.duration().years();
moment.duration().asYears();
```

As with the other getters for durations, `moment.duration().years()` gets the years.

`moment.duration().asYears()` gets the length of the duration in years.

### [Add Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/add/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/12-add.md)

```
moment.duration().add(Number, String);
moment.duration().add(Number);
moment.duration().add(Duration);
moment.duration().add(Object);
```

Mutates the original duration by adding time.

The same keys and shorthands used to create durations can be used here as the second argument.

```
var a = moment.duration(1, 'd');
var b = moment.duration(2, 'd');
a.add(b).days(); // 3
```

Note that adding an invalid duration to any other duration results in an invalid duration.

### [Subtract Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/subtract/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/13-subtract.md)

```
moment.duration().subtract(Number, String);
moment.duration().subtract(Number);
moment.duration().subtract(Duration);
moment.duration().subtract(Object);
```

Mutates the original duration by subtracting time.

The same keys and shorthands used to create durations can be used here as the second argument.

```
var a = moment.duration(3, 'd');
var b = moment.duration(2, 'd');
a.subtract(b).days(); // 1
```

Note that adding an invalid duration to any other duration results in an invalid duration.

### [Using Duration with Diff](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/diffing/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/14-diffing.md)

```
var duration = moment.duration(x.diff(y))
```

You can also use duration with `moment#diff` to get the duration between two moments. To do so, simply pass the `moment#diff` method into `moment#duration` as follows:

```
  var x = new moment()
  var y = new moment()
  var duration = moment.duration(x.diff(y))
  // returns duration object with the duration between x and y
```

See [here](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/difference/) for more information about `moment#diff`.

### [As Unit of Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/as/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/15-as.md)

```
moment.duration().as(String);
```

As an alternate to `Duration#asX`, you can use `Duration#as('x')`. All the [shorthand keys from](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/) `moment#add` apply here as well.

```
duration.as('hours');
duration.as('minutes');
duration.as('seconds');
duration.as('milliseconds');
```

Invalid durations return `NaN` for all units.

### [Get Unit of Time](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/get/) 2.1.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/16-get.md)

```
moment.duration().get(String);
```

As an alternate to `Duration#x()` getters, you can use `Duration#get('x')`. All the [shorthand keys from](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/) `moment#add` apply here as well.

```
duration.get('hours');
duration.get('minutes');
duration.get('seconds');
duration.get('milliseconds');
```

Invalid durations return `NaN` for all units.

### [As JSON](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/as-json/) 2.9.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/17-as-json.md)

```
moment.duration().toJSON();
```

When serializing a duration object to JSON, it will be represented as an ISO8601 string.

```
JSON.stringify({
    postDuration : moment.duration(5, 'm')
}); // '{"postDuration":"PT5M"}'
```

Invalid durations return `Invalid Date` as json representation.

### [Is a Duration](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/is-a-duration/) 1.6.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/18-is-a-duration.md)

To check if a variable is a moment duration object, use `moment.isDuration()`.

```
moment.isDuration() // false
moment.isDuration(new Date()) // false
moment.isDuration(moment()) // false
moment.isDuration(moment.duration()) // true
moment.isDuration(moment.duration(2, 'minutes')) // true
```

### [As ISO 8601 String](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/as-iso-string/) 2.8.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/19-as-iso-string.md)

```
moment.duration().toISOString();
```

Returns duration in string as specified by [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

```
moment.duration(1, 'd').toISOString() // "P1D"
```

Format `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS` description:

| Unit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| P | \_P\_ stands for period. Placed at the start of the duration representation. |
| Y | Year |
| M | Month |
| D | Day |
| T | Designator that precedes the time components. |
| H | Hour |
| M | Minute |
| S | Second |

### [Locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/locale/) 2.17.1+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/08-durations/20-locale.md)

```
moment.duration().locale();
moment.duration().locale(String);
```

You can get or set the locale of a duration using `locale(...)`. The locale will affect the duration's string methods, like `humanize()`. See the [intl](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/) section for more information on internationalization generally.

```
moment.duration(1, "minutes").locale("en").humanize(); // a minute
moment.duration(1, "minutes").locale("fr").humanize(); // une minute
moment.duration(1, "minutes").locale("es").humanize(); // un minuto
```

Suffixes in `humanize()` are also internationalized:

```
moment.duration(1, "minutes").locale("en").humanize(true); // in a minute
moment.duration(1, "minutes").locale("fr").humanize(true); // dans une minute
moment.duration(1, "minutes").locale("es").humanize(true); // en un minuto

moment.duration(-1, "minutes").locale("en").humanize(true); // a minute ago
moment.duration(-1, "minutes").locale("fr").humanize(true); // il y a une minute
moment.duration(-1, "minutes").locale("es").humanize(true); // hace un minuto
```

## [Utilities](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/utilities/)

Moment exposes some methods which may be useful to people extending the library or writing custom parsers.

### [Normalize Units](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/utilities/normalize-units/) 2.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/09-utilities/01-normalize-units.md)

```
moment.normalizeUnits(String);
```

Many of Moment's functions allow the caller to pass in aliases for unit enums. For example, all of the `get`s below are equivalent.

```
var m = moment();
m.get('y');
m.get('year');
m.get('years');
```

If you're extending the library, you may want access to Moment's facilities for that in order to better align your functionality with Moment's.

```
moment.normalizeUnits('y');      // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('Y');      // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('year');   // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('years');  // 'year'
moment.normalizeUnits('YeARS');  // 'year'
```

### [Invalid](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/utilities/invalid/) 2.3.0+

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/09-utilities/02-invalid.md)

You can create your own invalid Moment objects, which is useful in making your own parser.

```
var m = moment.invalid();
m.isValid();                      // false
m.format();                       // 'Invalid date'
m.parsingFlags().userInvalidated; // true
```

`invalid` also accepts an object which specifies which parsing flags to set. This will *not* set the `userInvalidated` parsing flag unless it's one of the properties specified.

```
var m = moment.invalid({invalidMonth: 'Actober'});
m.parsingFlags().invalidMonth; // 'Actober'
```

You need not specify parsing flags recognized by Moment; the Moment will be invalid nonetheless, and the parsing flags will be returned by `parsingFlags()`.

## [Plugins](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/)

Some other people have made plugins for Moment.js that may be useful to you.

### [Strftime](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/strftime/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/01-strftime.md)

```
npm install moment-strftime
```

If you are more comfortable working with strftime instead of LDML-like parsing tokens, you can use Ben Oakes' plugin `moment-strftime`.

The repository is located at [github.com/benjaminoakes/moment-strftime](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/moment-strftime).

### [MSDate](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/msdate/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/02-msdate.md)

If you are using OLE Automation dates in .NET check out Markit On Demand's `moment-msdate`. Using this plugin allows you to format OA dates into JavaScript dates and vice-versa.

Convert a `moment` to an OA date:

```
moment().toOADate(); // a floating point number
```

Or, convert an OA date to a `moment`:

```
moment.fromOADate(41493); // Wed Aug 07 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (MDT)
```

More information and detailed docs can be found on GitHub at [http://markitondemand.github.io/moment-msdate/](http://markitondemand.github.io/moment-msdate/).

### [Java DateFormat Parser](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/jdateformatparser/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/03-jdateformatparser.md)

```
npm install moment-jdateformatparser
```

If you want to work with the `java.text.DateFormat` you can use this plugin.

For example,

```
moment("2013-12-24 14:30").formatWithJDF("dd.MM.yyyy");  // returns the formatted date "24.12.2013"
moment().toJDFString("DD.MM.YYYY");  // returns the Java format pattern "dd.MM.yyyy"
```

The repository is located at [github.com/MadMG/moment-jdateformatparser](https://github.com/MadMG/moment-jdateformatparser).

### [Date Ranges](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/range/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/04-range.md)

### [Twix](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/twix/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/05-twix.md)

Another range plugin is Isaac Cambron's library `Twix`. It has many range-related features and excels at formatting ranges readably. For example,

```
var t = moment("1/25/1982 9:30 AM").twix("1/25/1982 1:30 PM");
t.isCurrent(); // false
t.count('minutes'); // 241
t.format();  // 'Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM'
t.simpleFormat("h:m"); // '9:30 - 1:30'
```

Full documentation of all the options and features is [here](http://icambron.github.io/twix.js).

It's available on npm like so:

```
npm install twix
```

Or just grab the JS file from [here](https://raw.github.com/icambron/twix.js/master/dist/twix.js).

### [Precise Range](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/preciserange/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/06-preciserange.md)

```
npm install moment-precise-range-plugin
```

The [Precise Range](https://codebox.org.uk/pages/moment-date-range-plugin) plugin, written by [Rob Dawson](https://github.com/codebox), can be used to display exact, human-readable representations of date/time ranges:

```
moment("2014-01-01 12:00:00").preciseDiff("2015-03-04 16:05:06");
 // 1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds
```

```
moment.preciseDiff("2014-01-01 12:00:00", "2014-04-20 12:00:00");
// 3 months 19 days
```

To obtain the raw numeric values rather than a string, pass the value `true` as the third argument to the method:

```
moment.preciseDiff(m1, m2, true); 
// {years : 0, months : 1, days : 2, hours : 3, minutes : 4, seconds : 5, firstDateWasLater : false}
```

### [ISO Calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/isocalendar/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/07-isocalendar.md)

```
npm install moment-isocalendar
```

If you are looking for a Python-like isocalendar method, you can use Rocky Meza's plugin

`moment-isocalendar`

Calling the isocalendar method on a moment will return an array like the following:

`[year, week_of_year, day_of_week, minutes_since_midnight]`

```
moment().isocalendar(); // [2012, 8, 5, 870]
```

You can also reconstruct a moment from a isocalendar array.

```
moment.fromIsocalendar([2011, 51, 5, 870]).format('LLLL');
// "Friday, December 23 2011 2:30 PM"
```

The repository is located at [github.com/fusionbox/moment-isocalendar](https://github.com/fusionbox/moment-isocalendar).

### [Jalaali Calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/jalaali/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/08-jalaali.md)

```
npm install moment-jalaali
```

If you want to work with Jalaali calendar system (Jalali, Persian, Khorshidi or Shamsi), you can use Behrang Noruzi Niya's plugin `moment-jalaali`.

When installed, it will wrap `moment` and moment will be able to format and parse Jalaali years and months. Here is a short example:

```
var m = moment('1360/5/26', 'jYYYY/jM/jD'); // Parse a Jalaali date.
m.format('jYYYY/jM/jD [is] YYYY/M/D'); // 1360/5/26 is 1981/8/17
```

The repository is located at [github.com/behrang/moment-jalaali](https://github.com/behrang/moment-jalaali).

### [Hijri Calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/hijri/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/09-hijri.md)

If you want to work with Hijri calendar then you can use `moment-hijri` plugin. `moment-hijri` is a moment plugin for the Hijri lunar calendar based on [Umm al-Qura](http://www.ummulqura.org.sa/) calculations. This plugin is developed by [Suhail Alkowaileet](https://github.com/xsoh).

When you install it, it will wrap `moment` and you will be able to parse Hijri dates. Here is a short example:

```
m = moment('1410/8/28', 'iYYYY/iM/iD'); // Parse a Hijri date.
m.format('iYYYY/iM/iD [is] YYYY/M/D'); // 1410/8/28 is 1990/3/25
```

The repository is located at [github.com/xsoh/moment-hijri](https://github.com/xsoh/moment-hijri).

### [Islamic Civil Calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/islamic-civil/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/10-islamic-civil.md)

### [Recur](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/recur/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/11-recur.md)

If you need to work with recurring dates, you can use Casey Trimm's plugin `moment-recur`.

This plugin will allow you to create length-based intervals (days, weeks, etc.) and calendar-based intervals (daysOfMonth, monthsOfYear, etc.).

It provides a `matches` function to test whether a date recurs according to the rules set, as well as generator functions to get the next and previous dates in a series.

The repository, documentation, and many more examples can be found at [github.com/c-trimm/moment-recur](https://github.com/c-trimm/moment-recur)

```
var interval = moment( "01/01/2014" ).recur().every(2).days(); // Length Interval
interval.matches( "01/03/2014" ); // true
interval.next( 2, "L" ); // ["01/03/2014", "01/05/2014"]
interval.forget( "days" ); // Remove a rule
interval.dayOfMonth( 10 ); // Calendar Interval
interval.matches( "05/10/2014" ); // true
interval.previous( 2, "L" ); // ["12/10/2013", "11/10/2013"]
```

### [Twitter](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/twitter/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/12-twitter.md)

If you're trying to format times for tweets like the way Twitter does, you can use the [moment.twitter](https://github.com/hijonathan/moment.twitter) plugin by [@hijonathan](https://github.com/hijonathan).

It's a simple way to display both short and long versions of human-readable timestamps.

```
moment().subtract(5, 'hours').twitterLong();
// 5 hours
```

Yes, it does smart pluralization.

```
moment().subtract(1, 'hour').twitterLong();
// 1 hour
```

Not short enough for you?

```
moment().subtract(6, 'days').twitterShort();
// 6d
```

### [Fiscal Quarters](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/fquarter/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/13-fquarter.md)

If you ever have need for [Fiscal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year), Calendar or Academic quarters, you can use the [moment-fquarter](https://github.com/robgallen/moment-fquarter) plugin by [@robgallen](https://github.com/robgallen).

At its simplest, just call the fquarter method on any moment object. It returns a formatted string with April being the first quarter.

```
moment("2013-01-01").fquarter();
// Q4 2012/13
```

You can pass in any month as the starting quarter, e.g. July

```
moment("2013-01-01").fquarter(7);
// Q3 2012/13
```

If you want calendar quarters, start in January

```
moment("2013-01-01").fquarter(1);
// Q1 2013
```

### [Parse Date Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/parseformat/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/14-parseformat.md)

```
npm install moment-parseformat
```

This plugin extracts the format of a date/time string.

```
var format = moment.parseFormat('Thursday, February 6th, 2014 9:20pm');
// dddd, MMMM Do, YYYY h:mma
moment().format(format); // format
```

That allows to create smart date inputs that let your users set a Date/Time and lets you extract the user's preferred format for future usage. Find an example usage of it at [minutes.io](https://minutes.io/new/Meeting).

The Plugin has been authored by [@gr2m](https://github.com/gr2m). Links: [Demo](http://gr2m.github.io/moment-parseformat/) | [Source](https://github.com/gr2m/moment.parseFormat)

### [Round](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/round/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/15-round.md)

This plugin will round date/time to a given interval.

For example,

```
require('moment-round');
var m = new moment(); // 2015-06-18 15:30:19
m.round(5, 'seconds'); // 2015-06-18 15:30:20
m.ceil(3, 'minutes'); // 2015-06-18 15:33:00
m.floor(16, 'hours'); // 2015-06-18 00:00:00
m.ceil(21, 'hours'); // 2015-06-18 21:00:00
m.ceil(20, 'hours'); // 2015-06-19 00:00:00
```

The repository is located at [github.com/WebDevTmas/moment-round](https://github.com/WebDevTmas/moment-round).

### [Transform](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/transform/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/16-transform.md)

```
bower install moment-transform
```

[`moment-transform`](https://a----.github.io/moment-transform/) is a plugin that manipulated dates through patterns. You can use basic operations –set/add/subtract– on individual parts (hours, month, …) of a Moment instance.

```
moment().transform('YYYY-MM-+01 00:00:00.000'); // Tonight at midnight
moment().transform('14:30:00.000'); // Today, 2:30 pm
moment().transform('YYYY-MM--30 00:00:00.000'); // 30 days ago
```

Optional parameters lets you specify custom patterns and force strict pattern usage (non-alphabetic characters are not mandatory in passed string by default).

```
moment().transform('+01MMYYYY', 'DD/MM/YYYY', false); // Tomorrow, same time
moment().transform('+01MMYYYY', 'DD/MM/YYYY', true); // Invalid date
```

You can see it live [there](https://a----.github.io/moment-transform/) while the repository is [here](https://github.com/A----/moment-transform).

### [Taiwan Calendar](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/taiwan/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/17-taiwan.md)

```
npm install moment-taiwan
```

If you want to work with Taiwan calendar system , you can use Bradwoo8621's plugin `moment-taiwan`.

When installed, it will wrap `moment` and moment will be able to format and parse Taiwan years. Here is a short example:

```
m = moment('104/01/01', 'tYY/MM/DD') // Parse a Taiwan date
m.format('tYY/MM/DD [is] YYYY/M/D') // 104/01/01 is 2015/01/01

m.twYear() // 104
```

The repository is located at [github.com/bradwoo8621/moment-taiwan](https://github.com/bradwoo8621/moment-taiwan).

### [Duration Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/duration-format/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/18-duration-format.md)

```
npm install moment-duration-format
```

This is a plugin that will allow comprehensive formatting of Moment Durations.

For example,

```
moment.duration(123, "minutes").format("h:mm");
// "2:03"
```

The repository is located at [github.com/jsmreese/moment-duration-format](https://github.com/jsmreese/moment-duration-format).

### [Timer](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/timer/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/19-timer.md)

This is a Moment.js plugin that allows the use of timers, which offer much more control than the native JavaScript timers. It's basically a rewrite of JavaScripts own setInterval and setTimeout.

For example,

```
var timer = moment.duration(5, "seconds").timer({loop: true}, function() {
  // Callback
});
```

The repository is located at [github.com/SeverinDK/moment-timer](https://github.com/SeverinDK/moment-timer).

### [Business](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/moment-business/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/20-moment-business.md)

```
npm install moment-business
```

This is a Moment.js library that allows Moment operations for Western work weeks: 7 day weeks where Saturday and Sunday are non-work days.

For example,

```
import business from 'moment-business';

// true if the moment is Mon-Fri, false otherwise
business.isWeekDay(someMoment);

// Adds five work days to the Moment
business.addWeekDays(someMoment, 5);
```

The repository is located at [github.com/jmeas/moment-business](https://github.com/jmeas/moment-business).

### [Short Date Formatter](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/shortformat/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/21-shortformat.md)

If you want to format times in a short way, you can use the [moment-shortformat](https://github.com/researchgate/moment-shortformat) plugin by [@researchgate](https://github.com/researchgate).

It is based on and similar to the moment.twitter plugin but has a different output.

```
moment().subtract(5, 'hours').short();
// 5h ago
moment().add(5, 'hours').short();
// in 5h
```

You can also disable the use of the [relative time templates](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time/)

```
moment().subtract(1, 'hour').short(false);
// 1h
```

If the date is too far in the future or the past it will display like that

```
moment().subtract(500, 'days').short();
// 5 Mar, 1970
```

### [German Holiday (Feiertag)](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/plugins/german-holiday/)

[edit](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com/blob/master/docs/moment/10-plugins/22-german-holiday.md)

```
npm install moment-feiertage --save
```

This (moment-feiertage) is a Moment.js plugin to determine if a date is a German holiday. Holidays are taken from Wikipedia (de). It's a bit complicated to determine if a date is a holiday, because religious holidays vary every year and differ within the 16 German states.

Made by [DaniSchenk](https://github.com/DaniSchenk).

```
var someDateInSomeStates = moment('2018-11-01').isHoliday(['BW', 'SH', 'TH']);
/* returns {
  allStates: false,
  holidayName: 'Allerheiligen',
  holidayStates: [ 'BW' ],
  testedStates: [ 'BW', 'SH', 'TH' ]
}*/
```

The repository is located at [github.com/DaniSchenk/moment-feiertage](https://github.com/DaniSchenk/moment-feiertage).
