# Situating "Making Sense with Obsidian"

## Pre-word (Share notes!)

We find shared note taking really helpful so we have setup a pad in [[Shared notes and questions]] with subheadings for each section of this workshop.

We will be talking about cultivating research through knowledge bases and how we do that using this tool called Obsidian.

## A little bit about us:

### George (they/she/he)
Researcher, dev\*hacker, queer instigator and crip trouble. In their work they create and develop digital tools and collective infrastructures\*protocols for distributed network infrastructures. They are currently finishing off a PhD in queer and crip collective methods towards automated socio-technical infrastructure. They teach and mentor experimental media, speculative computing and coding skills at I-Dat, UoP. They are also a founding member of In-grid, a trans\*feminist collective that produces events, skills shares and socio-technical infrastructures.
### Batool (they/them)
Artist, hacker, educator and sometimes a technician. In my practice I work with historicising computing within non-western contexts, and I teach at the CCI, UaL on the Creative Robotics programme. 
### Both!
What we're sharing today is a tool that's been a backbone to help maintain how we work on everything, from research to journalling, and recipes to yoga.

Both of us are also members of In-grid (artist collective) based in London, were working on collective methods and approaches of decentralised collective labour within infra \* structural transformation. We also host parties, skills workshops and events.

## Introduce yourselves!

Maybe say:
- Name
- Pronouns
- What you do + are interested in using obsidian for?

If you want to add this to the [[Shared notes and questions]] please do!

## Knowledge base & Research Collection

What is a Knowledge base? 

Well it basically just a simple term for a centralised system to collect, compile and work through your knowledge!

Our uses of this tool, in the context of research:
- note-taking
- A organisational system of files, notes & ideas.
- Using links, connections and data to create your groupings, rhythms and movements within notes. 
- Using different modes like visualising + querying your knowledge collection. 
- Relating knowledge to other knowledge, not just to when and where you learned it.

## Why we personally have a knowledge base:

We will go a bit more into this on the second day, but we find it really beneficial to practice our own systems + methods for collating and collecting our research and knowledge! This is a way to actively practice your knowledge-making instead of defaulting to existing systems, as it lets us learn what works for us and what doesn't.

We practice this by:
- Organising our own knowledge, and seeing how that feels‚≠êworks.
- Learning to create helpful way-finding, especially nueroüçÆdivergent learning & rhythms.
- Non-compartmentalising and creating a trans‚≠êdisciplinary knowledge practice.
- Emptying our brains, not having to remember everything.
- Sorting through information overload & overwhelm, creating steps, routines, cycles that we can catch ourselves with.

## Why Obsidian
We are **NOT** working for Obsidian, and it is a proprietary tool. It is an _open_ proprietary tool with a big and helpful community who create plugins/addons that make it super flexible and adaptable to many uses and contexts. (you can make your own plugins too very easily!) The files are in [[01_General syntax|markdown]] so is easily transferred to another markdown (md) based software (there are many), and even be published online in markdown.

### Customisable
It enables many levels of access to potentially change _everything_ about the interface and how you use it. In this workshop we will use templates and community-made plugins, and even customise the interface with themes!!!

### Local & not a subscription:
By default everything is saved locally, not cloud dependant. They do offer a syncing service between devices, this is the only paid service. There are syncing alternatives that are free and not-cloud based [[README#Extra & Cool|Look in here]].

# What we're doing today

We will share some technical skills as well as some practice approaches that we find work really well. Some of these will refer to standardised/popular methods, but most will be a combination of approaches we've found that work for us. 

We will create a small collection of notes and files as a starting point that you can expand on and start to test‚≠êpractice. We've made a folder called "Demo Folder" where you can create the exercises we will be going through today or take notes on what we're doing.
